HARRY
POTTER
AND
THE
SORCERER'S
CHAPTER
THE
BOY
WHO
MR
AND
MRS
DURSLEY
OF
NUMBER
FOUR
PRIVET
DRIVE
WERE
PROUD
TO
THAT
THEY
WERE
PERFECTLY
NORMAL
THANK
YOU
VERY
MUCH
THEY
WERE
THE
PEOPLE
YOU'D
EXPECT
TO
BE
INVOLVED
IN
ANYTHING
STRANGE
OR
MYSTERIOUS
BECAUSE
THEY
JUST
DIDN'T
HOLD
WITH
SUCH
NONSENSE
MR
DURSLEY
WAS
THE
DIRECTOR
OF
A
FIRM
CALLED
GRUNNINGS
WHICH
DRILLS
HE
WAS
A
BIG
BEEFY
MAN
WITH
HARDLY
ANY
NECK
ALTHOUGH
HE
HAVE
A
VERY
LARGE
MUSTACHE
MRS
DURSLEY
WAS
THIN
AND
BLONDE
AND
NEARLY
TWICE
THE
USUAL
AMOUNT
OF
NECK
WHICH
CAME
IN
VERY
USEFUL
AS
SPENT
SO
MUCH
OF
HER
TIME
CRANING
OVER
GARDEN
FENCES
SPYING
ON
NEIGHBORS
THE
DURSLEYS
HAD
A
SMALL
SON
CALLED
DUDLEY
AND
IN
OPINION
THERE
WAS
NO
FINER
BOY
ANYWHERE
THE
DURSLEYS
HAD
EVERYTHING
THEY
WANTED
BUT
THEY
ALSO
HAD
A
SECRET
THEIR
GREATEST
FEAR
WAS
THAT
SOMEBODY
WOULD
DISCOVER
IT
THEY
THINK
THEY
COULD
BEAR
IT
IF
ANYONE
FOUND
OUT
ABOUT
THE
POTTERS
MRS
POTTER
WAS
MRS
DURSLEY'S
SISTER
BUT
THEY
HADN'T
MET
FOR
SEVERAL
YEARS
IN
FACT
MRS
DURSLEY
PRETENDED
SHE
DIDN'T
HAVE
A
SISTER
BECAUSE
SISTER
AND
HER
GOOD
FOR
NOTHING
HUSBAND
WERE
AS
UNDURSLEYISH
AS
IT
POSSIBLE
TO
BE
THE
DURSLEYS
SHUDDERED
TO
THINK
WHAT
THE
NEIGHBORS
SAY
IF
THE
POTTERS
ARRIVED
IN
THE
STREET
THE
DURSLEYS
KNEW
THAT
POTTERS
HAD
A
SMALL
SON
TOO
BUT
THEY
HAD
NEVER
EVEN
SEEN
HIM
THIS
WAS
ANOTHER
GOOD
REASON
FOR
KEEPING
THE
POTTERS
AWAY
THEY
DIDN'T
DUDLEY
MIXING
WITH
A
CHILD
LIKE
THAT
WHEN
MR
AND
MRS
DURSLEY
WOKE
UP
ON
THE
DULL
GRAY
TUESDAY
OUR
STARTS
THERE
WAS
NOTHING
ABOUT
THE
CLOUDY
SKY
OUTSIDE
TO
SUGGEST
STRANGE
AND
MYSTERIOUS
THINGS
WOULD
SOON
BE
HAPPENING
ALL
OVER
COUNTRY
MR
DURSLEY
HUMMED
AS
HE
PICKED
OUT
HIS
MOST
BORING
TIE
WORK
AND
MRS
DURSLEY
GOSSIPED
AWAY
HAPPILY
AS
SHE
WRESTLED
A
DUDLEY
INTO
HIS
HIGH
CHAIR
NONE
OF
THEM
NOTICED
A
LARGE
TAWNY
OWL
FLUTTER
PAST
THE
WINDOW
AT
HALF
PAST
EIGHT
MR
DURSLEY
PICKED
UP
HIS
BRIEFCASE
PECKED
MRS
DURSLEY
ON
THE
CHEEK
AND
TRIED
TO
KISS
DUDLEY
GOOD
BYE
BUT
MISSED
BECAUSE
DUDLEY
WAS
NOW
HAVING
A
TANTRUM
AND
THROWING
HIS
CEREAL
AT
WALLS
"LITTLE
TYKE
"
CHORTLED
MR
DURSLEY
AS
HE
LEFT
THE
HOUSE
HE
INTO
HIS
CAR
AND
BACKED
OUT
OF
NUMBER
FOUR'S
DRIVE
IT
WAS
ON
THE
CORNER
OF
THE
STREET
THAT
HE
NOTICED
THE
FIRST
SIGN
SOMETHING
PECULIAR
A
CAT
READING
A
MAP
FOR
A
SECOND
MR
DIDN'T
REALIZE
WHAT
HE
HAD
SEEN
THEN
HE
JERKED
HIS
HEAD
AROUND
LOOK
AGAIN
THERE
WAS
A
TABBY
CAT
STANDING
ON
THE
CORNER
OF
DRIVE
BUT
THERE
WASN'T
A
MAP
IN
SIGHT
WHAT
COULD
HE
HAVE
BEEN
OF
IT
MUST
HAVE
BEEN
A
TRICK
OF
THE
LIGHT
MR
DURSLEY
BLINKED
STARED
AT
THE
CAT
IT
STARED
BACK
AS
MR
DURSLEY
DROVE
AROUND
CORNER
AND
UP
THE
ROAD
HE
WATCHED
THE
CAT
IN
HIS
MIRROR
IT
WAS
READING
THE
SIGN
THAT
SAID
PRIVET
DRIVE
NO
LOOKING
AT
THE
SIGN
COULDN'T
READ
MAPS
OR
SIGNS
MR
DURSLEY
GAVE
HIMSELF
A
LITTLE
SHAKE
PUT
THE
CAT
OUT
OF
HIS
MIND
AS
HE
DROVE
TOWARD
TOWN
HE
THOUGHT
NOTHING
EXCEPT
A
LARGE
ORDER
OF
DRILLS
HE
WAS
HOPING
TO
GET
THAT
DAY
BUT
ON
THE
EDGE
OF
TOWN
DRILLS
WERE
DRIVEN
OUT
OF
HIS
MIND
BY
ELSE
AS
HE
SAT
IN
THE
USUAL
MORNING
TRAFFIC
JAM
HE
COULDN'T
NOTICING
THAT
THERE
SEEMED
TO
BE
A
LOT
OF
STRANGELY
DRESSED
ABOUT
PEOPLE
IN
CLOAKS
MR
DURSLEY
COULDN'T
BEAR
PEOPLE
WHO
DRESSED
FUNNY
CLOTHES
THE
GETUPS
YOU
SAW
ON
YOUNG
PEOPLE
HE
SUPPOSED
WAS
SOME
STUPID
NEW
FASHION
HE
DRUMMED
HIS
FINGERS
ON
THE
WHEEL
AND
HIS
EYES
FELL
ON
A
HUDDLE
OF
THESE
WEIRDOS
STANDING
CLOSE
BY
THEY
WERE
WHISPERING
EXCITEDLY
TOGETHER
MR
DURSLEY
ENRAGED
TO
SEE
THAT
A
COUPLE
OF
THEM
WEREN'T
YOUNG
AT
ALL
WHY
THAT
HAD
TO
BE
OLDER
THAN
HE
WAS
AND
WEARING
AN
EMERALD
GREEN
CLOAK
NERVE
OF
HIM
BUT
THEN
IT
STRUCK
MR
DURSLEY
THAT
THIS
WAS
PROBABLY
SILLY
STUNT
THESE
PEOPLE
WERE
OBVIOUSLY
COLLECTING
FOR
SOMETHING
YES
THAT
WOULD
BE
IT
THE
TRAFFIC
MOVED
ON
AND
A
FEW
MINUTES
LATER
MR
DURSLEY
ARRIVED
IN
THE
GRUNNINGS
PARKING
LOT
HIS
MIND
BACK
ON
DRILLS
MR
DURSLEY
ALWAYS
SAT
WITH
HIS
BACK
TO
THE
WINDOW
IN
HIS
OFFICE
ON
NINTH
FLOOR
IF
HE
HADN'T
HE
MIGHT
HAVE
FOUND
IT
HARDER
TO
ON
DRILLS
THAT
MORNING
HE
DIDN'T
SEE
THE
OWLS
SWOOP
ING
PAST
IN
DAYLIGHT
THOUGH
PEOPLE
DOWN
IN
THE
STREET
DID
THEY
POINTED
AND
OPEN
MOUTHED
AS
OWL
AFTER
OWL
SPED
OVERHEAD
MOST
OF
THEM
HAD
SEEN
AN
OWL
EVEN
AT
NIGHTTIME
MR
DURSLEY
HOWEVER
HAD
A
NORMAL
OWL
FREE
MORNING
HE
YELLED
AT
FIVE
DIFFERENT
PEOPLE
HE
SEVERAL
IMPORTANT
TELEPHONE
CALLS
AND
SHOUTED
A
BIT
MORE
HE
WAS
IN
VERY
GOOD
MOOD
UNTIL
LUNCHTIME
WHEN
HE
THOUGHT
HE'D
STRETCH
HIS
AND
WALK
ACROSS
THE
ROAD
TO
BUY
HIMSELF
A
BUN
FROM
THE
BAKERY
HE'D
FORGOTTEN
ALL
ABOUT
THE
PEOPLE
IN
CLOAKS
UNTIL
HE
PASSED
A
GROUP
THEM
NEXT
TO
THE
BAKER'S
HE
EYED
THEM
ANGRILY
AS
HE
PASSED
HE
KNOW
WHY
BUT
THEY
MADE
HIM
UNEASY
THIS
BUNCH
WERE
EXCITEDLY
TOO
AND
HE
COULDN'T
SEE
A
SINGLE
COLLECTING
TIN
IT
WAS
HIS
WAY
BACK
PAST
THEM
CLUTCHING
A
LARGE
DOUGHNUT
IN
A
BAG
THAT
CAUGHT
A
FEW
WORDS
OF
WHAT
THEY
WERE
SAYING
"THE
POTTERS
THAT'S
RIGHT
THAT'S
WHAT
I
HEARD
YES
THEIR
SON
MR
DURSLEY
STOPPED
DEAD
FEAR
FLOODED
HIM
HE
LOOKED
BACK
AT
WHISPERERS
AS
IF
HE
WANTED
TO
SAY
SOMETHING
TO
THEM
BUT
THOUGHT
OF
IT
HE
DASHED
BACK
ACROSS
THE
ROAD
HURRIED
UP
TO
HIS
OFFICE
SNAPPED
AT
SECRETARY
NOT
TO
DISTURB
HIM
SEIZED
HIS
TELEPHONE
AND
HAD
FINISHED
DIALING
HIS
HOME
NUMBER
WHEN
HE
CHANGED
HIS
MIND
HE
PUT
RECEIVER
BACK
DOWN
AND
STROKED
HIS
MUSTACHE
THINKING
NO
HE
BEING
STUPID
POTTER
WASN'T
SUCH
AN
UNUSUAL
NAME
HE
WAS
SURE
THERE
LOTS
OF
PEOPLE
CALLED
POTTER
WHO
HAD
A
SON
CALLED
HARRY
COME
TO
OF
IT
HE
WASN'T
EVEN
SURE
HIS
NEPHEW
WAS
CALLED
HARRY
HE'D
NEVER
SEEN
THE
BOY
IT
MIGHT
HAVE
BEEN
HARVEY
OR
HAROLD
THERE
WAS
NO
IN
WORRYING
MRS
DURSLEY
SHE
ALWAYS
GOT
SO
UPSET
AT
ANY
MENTION
OF
SISTER
HE
DIDN'T
BLAME
HER
IF
HE'D
HAD
A
SISTER
LIKE
THAT
BUT
THE
SAME
THOSE
PEOPLE
IN
CLOAKS
HE
FOUND
IT
A
LOT
HARDER
TO
CONCENTRATE
ON
DRILLS
THAT
AFTERNOON
WHEN
HE
LEFT
THE
BUILDING
AT
FIVE
O'CLOCK
HE
WAS
STILL
SO
WORRIED
HE
WALKED
STRAIGHT
INTO
SOMEONE
JUST
OUTSIDE
THE
DOOR
"SORRY
"
HE
GRUNTED
AS
THE
TINY
OLD
MAN
STUMBLED
AND
ALMOST
FELL
WAS
A
FEW
SECONDS
BEFORE
MR
DURSLEY
REALIZED
THAT
THE
MAN
WAS
WEARING
VIOLET
CLOAK
HE
DIDN'T
SEEM
AT
ALL
UPSET
AT
BEING
ALMOST
KNOCKED
TO
GROUND
ON
THE
CONTRARY
HIS
FACE
SPLIT
INTO
A
WIDE
SMILE
AND
HE
SAID
A
SQUEAKY
VOICE
THAT
MADE
PASSERSBY
STARE
"DON'T
BE
SORRY
MY
DEAR
SIR
FOR
NOTHING
COULD
UPSET
ME

THE
OLD
MAN
HUGGED
MR
DURSLEY
AROUND
THE
MIDDLE

ROOTED
TO
THE
SPOT
HE
HAD
BEEN
HUGGED
BY
A
STRANGER
HE
ALSO
THOUGHT
HE
HAD
BEEN
CALLED
A
MUGGLE
WHATEVER
WAS
HE
WAS
RATTLED
HE
HURRIED
TO
HIS
CAR
AND
SET
OFF
FOR
HOME
HE
WAS
IMAGINING
THINGS
WHICH
HE
HAD
NEVER
HOPED
BEFORE
BECAUSE
DIDN'T
APPROVE
OF
IMAGINATION
AS
HE
PULLED
INTO
THE
DRIVEWAY
OF
NUMBER
FOUR
THE
FIRST
THING
HE
SAW
AND
IT
DIDN'T
IMPROVE
HIS
MOOD
WAS
THE
TABBY
CAT
HE'D
SPOTTED
MORNING
IT
WAS
NOW
SITTING
ON
HIS
GARDEN
WALL
HE
WAS
SURE
IT
WAS
SAME
ONE

HAD
THE
SAME
MARKINGS
AROUND
ITS
EYES
"SHOO

SAID
MR

LOUDLY

MR
DURSLEY

INVOLVED
THERE
WAS
NO
REASON
FOR
THEM
TO
COME
NEAR

FIXED
UNBLINKINGLY
ON
THE
FAR

DIDN'T
SO
MUCH
AS
QUIVER

SUDDENLY

THE

NARROWED
NOTHING
LIKE
THIS
MAN

SUDDENLY
AT
THE

BECAUSE
THE
CUPBOARD
UNDER
THE
STAIRS
WAS
FULL
OF
THEM
THAT
WAS
WHERE
HE
SLEPT
WHEN
HE
WAS
DRESSED
HE
WENT
DOWN
THE
HALL
INTO
THE
KITCHEN
THE
WAS
ALMOST
HIDDEN
BENEATH
ALL
DUDLEY'S
BIRTHDAY
PRESENTS
IT
LOOKED
THOUGH
DUDLEY
HAD
GOTTEN
THE
NEW
COMPUTER
HE
WANTED
NOT
TO
MENTION
SECOND
TELEVISION
AND
THE
RACING
BIKE
EXACTLY
WHY
DUDLEY
WANTED
RACING
BIKE
WAS
A
MYSTERY
TO
HARRY
AS
DUDLEY
WAS
VERY
FAT
AND
EXERCISE
UNLESS
OF
COURSE
IT
INVOLVED
PUNCHING
SOMEBODY
FAVORITE
PUNCHING
BAG
WAS
HARRY
BUT
HE
COULDN'T
OFTEN
CATCH
HIM
DIDN'T
LOOK
IT
BUT
HE
WAS
VERY
FAST
PERHAPS
IT
HAD
SOMETHING
TO
DO
WITH
LIVING
IN
A
DARK
CUPBOARD
BUT
HAD
ALWAYS
BEEN
SMALL
AND
SKINNY
FOR
HIS
AGE
HE
LOOKED
EVEN
SMALLER
SKINNIER
THAN
HE
REALLY
WAS
BECAUSE
ALL
HE
HAD
TO
WEAR
WERE
OLD
OF
DUDLEY'S
AND
DUDLEY
WAS
ABOUT
FOUR
TIMES
BIGGER
THAN
HE
WAS
HAD
A
THIN
FACE
KNOBBLY
KNEES
BLACK
HAIR
AND
BRIGHT
GREEN
EYES
WORE
ROUND
GLASSES
HELD
TOGETHER
WITH
A
LOT
OF
SCOTCH
TAPE
BECAUSE
ALL
THE
TIMES
DUDLEY
HAD
PUNCHED
HIM
ON
THE
NOSE
THE
ONLY
THING
LIKED
ABOUT
HIS
OWN
APPEARANCE
WAS
A
VERY
THIN
SCAR
ON
HIS
FOREHEAD
WAS
SHAPED
LIKE
A
BOLT
OF
LIGHTNING
HE
HAD
HAD
IT
AS
LONG
AS
HE
REMEMBER
AND
THE
FIRST
QUESTION
HE
COULD
EVER
REMEMBER
ASKING
HIS
PETUNIA
WAS
HOW
HE
HAD
GOTTEN
IT
"IN
THE
CAR
CRASH
WHEN
YOUR
PARENTS
DIED
"
SHE
HAD
SAID
"AND
DON'T
QUESTIONS
DON'T
ASK
QUESTIONS
THAT
WAS
THE
FIRST
RULE
FOR
A
QUIET
LIFE
WITH
DURSLEYS
UNCLE
VERNON
ENTERED
THE
KITCHEN
AS
HARRY
WAS
TURNING
OVER
THE
BACON
"COMB
YOUR
HAIR
"
HE
BARKED
BY
WAY
OF
A
MORNING
GREETING
ABOUT
ONCE
A
WEEK
UNCLE
VERNON
LOOKED
OVER
THE
TOP
OF
HIS
NEWSPAPER
SHOUTED
THAT
HARRY
NEEDED
A
HAIRCUT
HARRY
MUST
HAVE
HAD
MORE
THAN
THE
REST
OF
THE
BOYS
IN
HIS
CLASS
TOGETHER
BUT
IT
MADE
NO
DIFFERENCE
HIS
HAIR
SIMPLY
GREW
THAT
WAY
ALL
OVER
THE
PLACE
HARRY
WAS
FRYING
EGGS
BY
THE
TIME
DUDLEY
ARRIVED
IN
THE
KITCHEN
WITH
MOTHER
DUDLEY
LOOKED
A
LOT
LIKE
UNCLE
VERNON
HE
HAD
A
LARGE
PINK
FACE
NOT
MUCH
NECK
SMALL
WATERY
BLUE
EYES
AND
THICK
BLOND
HAIR
THAT
SMOOTHLY
ON
HIS
THICK
FAT
HEAD
AUNT
PETUNIA
OFTEN
SAID
THAT
LOOKED
LIKE
A
BABY
ANGEL
HARRY
OFTEN
SAID
THAT
DUDLEY
LOOKED
LIKE
PIG
IN
A
WIG
HARRY
PUT
THE
PLATES
OF
EGG
AND
BACON
ON
THE
TABLE
WHICH
WAS
AS
THERE
WASN'T
MUCH
ROOM
DUDLEY
MEANWHILE
WAS
COUNTING
HIS
PRESENTS
HIS
FACE
FELL
"THIRTY
SIX
"
HE
SAID
LOOKING
UP
AT
HIS
MOTHER
AND
FATHER
"THAT'S
LESS
THAN
LAST
YEAR
"DARLING
YOU
HAVEN'T
COUNTED
AUNTIE
MARGE'S

THIS
BIG
ONE
FROM
MOMMY
AND
DADDY
"ALL
RIGHT
THIRTY
SEVEN

"
SAID
DUDLEY
GOING
RED
IN
THE
FACE
HARRY
WHO
COULD
SEE
A
HUGE
DUDLEY
TANTRUM
COMING
ON
BEGAN
WOLFING
HIS
BACON
AS
FAST
AS
POSSIBLE
IN
CASE
DUDLEY
TURNED
THE
TABLE
OVER
AUNT
PETUNIA
OBVIOUSLY
SCENTED
DANGER
TOO
BECAUSE
SHE
SAID
QUICKLY
"AND
WE'LL
BUY
YOU
ANOTHER
TWO
PRESENTS
WHILE
WE'RE
OUT
TODAY
THAT
POPKIN
TWO
MORE
PRESENTS
IS
THAT
ALL
DUDLEY
THOUGHT
FOR
A
MOMENT
IT
LOOKED
LIKE
HARD
WORK
FINALLY
HE
SLOWLY
"SO
I'LL
HAVE
THIRTY
THIRTY
"THIRTY
NINE
SWEETUMS
"
SAID
AUNT
PETUNIA
"OH
"
DUDLEY
SAT
DOWN
HEAVILY
AND
GRABBED
THE
NEAREST
PARCEL
"ALL
THEN
UNCLE
VERNON
CHUCKLED
"LITTLE
TYKE
WANTS
HIS
MONEY'S
WORTH
JUST
HIS
FATHER
'ATTA
BOY

HE
RUFFLED
DUDLEY'S
HAIR
AT
THAT
MOMENT
THE
TELEPHONE
RANG
AND
AUNT
PETUNIA
WENT
TO
ANSWER
WHILE
HARRY
AND
UNCLE
VERNON
WATCHED
DUDLEY
UNWRAP
THE
RACING
BIKE
VIDEO

A
REMOTE
CONTROL
AIRPLANE
SIXTEEN
NEW

HE
WAS
RIPPING
THE
PAPER
OFF
A
GOLD
WRISTWATCH
WHEN
AUNT
CAME
BACK
FROM
THE
TELEPHONE
LOOKING
BOTH
ANGRY
AND
WORRIED
"BAD
NEWS
VERNON
"
SHE
SAID
"MRS
FIGG'S
BROKEN
HER
LEG
SHE
TAKE
HIM
"
SHE
JERKED
HER
HEAD
IN
HARRY'S
DIRECTION
DUDLEY'S
MOUTH
FELL
OPEN
IN
HORROR
BUT
HARRY'S
HEART
GAVE
A
LEAP
YEAR
ON
DUDLEY'S
BIRTHDAY
HIS
PARENTS
TOOK
HIM
AND
A
FRIEND
OUT
FOR
DAY
TO
ADVENTURE
PARKS
HAMBURGER
RESTAURANTS
OR
THE

YEAR
HARRY
WAS
LEFT
BEHIND
WITH
MRS
FIGG
A
MAD
OLD
LADY
WHO
LIVED
STREETS
AWAY
HARRY
HATED
IT
THERE
THE
WHOLE
HOUSE
SMELLED
OF
AND
MRS
FIGG
MADE
HIM
LOOK
AT
PHOTOGRAPHS
OF
ALL
THE
CATS
SHE'D
OWNED
"NOW

SAID
AUNT
PETUNIA
LOOKING
FURIOUSLY
AT
HARRY
AS
THOUGH
PLANNED
THIS
HARRY
KNEW
HE
OUGHT
TO
FEEL
SORRY
THAT
MRS
FIGG
BROKEN
HER
LEG
BUT
IT
WASN'T
EASY
WHEN
HE
REMINDED
HIMSELF
IT
WOULD
A
WHOLE
YEAR
BEFORE
HE
HAD
TO
LOOK
AT
TIBBLES
SNOWY
MR
PAWS
TUFTY
AGAIN
"WE
COULD
PHONE

UNCLE
VERNON
SUGGESTED
"DON'T

HATES
THE
BOY
THE
DURSLEYS
OFTEN
SPOKE
ABOUT
HARRY

THIS
AS

RATHER
AS

HE
WAS

NASTY
THAT
UNDERSTAND

HARRY
PUT
IN
HOPEFULLY
(HE'D
BE
ABLE
WATCH
WHAT
HE
WANTED
ON
TELEVISION
FOR
A
CHANGE
AND
MAYBE
EVEN
HAVE
A
ON
DUDLEY'S
COMPUTER)
AUNT
PETUNIA
LOOKED
AS
THOUGH
SHE'D
JUST
SWALLOWED
A
LEMON
"AND
COME
BACK
AND
FIND
THE
HOUSE
IN
RUINS
"
SHE
SNARLED
"I
WON'T
BLOW
UP
THE
HOUSE
"
SAID
HARRY
BUT
THEY
WEREN'T
LISTENING
"I
SUPPOSE
WE
COULD
TAKE
HIM
TO
THE
ZOO
"
SAID
AUNT
PETUNIA
SLOWLY
"
AND
LEAVE
HIM
IN
THE
CAR
"THAT
CAR'S
NEW
HE'S
NOT
SITTING
IN
IT
ALONE
DUDLEY
BEGAN
TO
CRY
LOUDLY
IN
FACT
HE
WASN'T
REALLY
CRYING
IT
BEEN
YEARS
SINCE
HE'D
REALLY
CRIED
BUT
HE
KNEW
THAT
IF
HE
SCREWED
HIS
FACE
AND
WAILED
HIS
MOTHER
WOULD
GIVE
HIM
ANYTHING
HE
WANTED
"DINKY
DUDDYDUMS
DON'T

SHE
CRIED
FLINGING
HER
ARMS
AROUND
HIM
"I
DON'T
WANT
HIM
T
T
TO
COME
"
DUDLEY
YELLED
BETWEEN
HUGE
PRETEND
SOBS
"HE
ALWAYS
SP
SPOILS
EVERYTHING
"
HE
SHOT
HARRY
A
GRIN
THROUGH
THE
GAP
IN
HIS
MOTHER'S
ARMS
JUST
THEN
THE
DOORBELL
RANG
"OH
GOOD
LORD
THEY'RE
HERE
"
SAID
PETUNIA
FRANTICALLY
AND
A
MOMENT
LATER
DUDLEY'S
BEST
FRIEND
POLKISS
WALKED
IN
WITH
HIS
MOTHER
PIERS
WAS
A
SCRAWNY
BOY
WITH
A
LIKE
A
RAT
HE
WAS
USUALLY
THE
ONE
WHO
HELD
PEOPLE'S
ARMS
BEHIND
BACKS
WHILE
DUDLEY
HIT
THEM
DUDLEY
STOPPED
PRETENDING
TO
CRY
AT
ONCE
HALF
AN
HOUR
LATER
HARRY
WHO
COULDN'T
BELIEVE
HIS
LUCK
WAS
SITTING
THE
BACK
OF
THE
DURSLEYS'
CAR
WITH
PIERS
AND
DUDLEY
ON
THE
WAY
TO
ZOO
FOR
THE
FIRST
TIME
IN
HIS
LIFE
HIS
AUNT
AND
UNCLE
HADN'T
BEEN
TO
THINK
OF
ANYTHING
ELSE
TO
DO
WITH
HIM
BUT
BEFORE
THEY'D
LEFT
VERNON
HAD
TAKEN
HARRY
ASIDE
"I'M
WARNING
YOU
"
HE
HAD
SAID
PUTTING
HIS
LARGE
PURPLE
FACE
RIGHT
CLOSE
TO
HARRY'S
"I'M
WARNING
YOU
NOW
BOY
ANY
FUNNY
BUSINESS
ANYTHING
AT
ALL
AND
YOU'LL
BE
IN
THAT
CUPBOARD
FROM
NOW
CHRISTMAS
"I'M
NOT
GOING
TO
DO
ANYTHING
"
SAID
HARRY
"HONESTLY
BUT
UNCLE
VERNON
DIDN'T
BELIEVE
HIM
NO
ONE
EVER
DID
THE
PROBLEM
WAS
STRANGE
THINGS
OFTEN
HAPPENED
AROUND
HARRY
AND
IT
JUST
NO
GOOD
TELLING
THE
DURSLEYS
HE
DIDN'T
MAKE
THEM
HAPPEN
ONCE
AUNT
PETUNIA
TIRED
OF
HARRY
COMING
BACK
FROM
THE
BARBERS
AS
THOUGH
HE
HADN'T
BEEN
AT
ALL
HAD
TAKEN
A
PAIR
OF
KITCHEN
AND
CUT
HIS
HAIR
SO
SHORT
HE
WAS
ALMOST
BALD
EXCEPT
FOR
HIS
BANGS
SHE
LEFT
"TO
HIDE
THAT
HORRIBLE
SCAR
"
DUDLEY
HAD
LAUGHED
HIMSELF
AT
HARRY
WHO
SPENT
A
SLEEPLESS
NIGHT
IMAGINING
SCHOOL
THE
NEXT
DAY
WHERE
HE
WAS
ALREADY
LAUGHED
AT
FOR
HIS
BAGGY
CLOTHES
AND
TAPED
GLASSES
NEXT
MORNING
HOWEVER
HE
HAD
GOTTEN
UP
TO
FIND
HIS
HAIR
EXACTLY
AS
HAD
BEEN
BEFORE
AUNT
PETUNIA
HAD
SHEARED
IT
OFF
HE
HAD
BEEN
GIVEN
A
IN
HIS
CUPBOARD
FOR
THIS
EVEN
THOUGH
HE
HAD
TRIED
TO
EXPLAIN
THAT
COULDN'T
EXPLAIN
HOW
IT
HAD
GROWN
BACK
SO
QUICKLY
ANOTHER
TIME
AUNT
PETUNIA
HAD
BEEN
TRYING
TO
FORCE
HIM
INTO
A
OLD
SWEATER
OF
DUDLEY'S
(BROWN
WITH
ORANGE
PUFF
BALLS)
THE
HARDER
TRIED
TO
PULL
IT
OVER
HIS
HEAD
THE
SMALLER
IT
SEEMED
TO
BECOME
FINALLY
IT
MIGHT
HAVE
FITTED
A
HAND
PUPPET
BUT
CERTAINLY
WOULDN'T
HARRY
AUNT
PETUNIA
HAD
DECIDED
IT
MUST
HAVE
SHRUNK
IN
THE
WASH
AND
HIS
GREAT
RELIEF
HARRY
WASN'T
PUNISHED
ON
THE
OTHER
HAND
HE'D
GOTTEN
INTO
TERRIBLE
TROUBLE
FOR
BEING
FOUND
THE
ROOF
OF
THE
SCHOOL
KITCHENS
DUDLEY'S
GANG
HAD
BEEN
CHASING
HIM
USUAL
WHEN
AS
MUCH
TO
HARRY'S
SURPRISE
AS
ANYONE
ELSE'S
THERE
HE
SITTING
ON
THE
CHIMNEY
THE
DURSLEYS
HAD
RECEIVED
A
VERY
ANGRY
FROM
HARRY'S
HEADMISTRESS
TELLING
THEM
HARRY
HAD
BEEN
CLIMBING
BUILDINGS
BUT
ALL
HE'D
TRIED
TO
DO
(AS
HE
SHOUTED
AT
UNCLE
THROUGH
THE
LOCKED
DOOR
OF
HIS
CUPBOARD)
WAS
JUMP
BEHIND
THE
BIG
CANS
OUTSIDE
THE
KITCHEN
DOORS
HARRY
SUPPOSED
THAT
THE
WIND
MUST
CAUGHT
HIM
IN
MID
JUMP
BUT
TODAY
NOTHING
WAS
GOING
TO
GO
WRONG
IT
WAS
EVEN
WORTH
BEING
DUDLEY
AND
PIERS
TO
BE
SPENDING
THE
DAY
SOMEWHERE
THAT
WASN'T
SCHOOL
HIS
CUPBOARD
OR
MRS
FIGG'S
CABBAGE
SMELLING
LIVING
ROOM
WHILE
HE
DROVE
UNCLE
VERNON
COMPLAINED
TO
AUNT
PETUNIA
HE
LIKED
COMPLAIN
ABOUT
THINGS
PEOPLE
AT
WORK
HARRY
THE
COUNCIL
HARRY
BANK
AND
HARRY
WERE
JUST
A
FEW
OF
HIS
FAVORITE
SUBJECTS
THIS
MORNING
IT
WAS
MOTORCYCLES
"
ROARING
ALONG
LIKE
MANIACS
THE
YOUNG
HOODLUMS
"
HE
SAID
AS
MOTORCYCLE
OVERTOOK
THEM
I
HAD
A
DREAM
ABOUT
A
MOTORCYCLE
"
SAID
HARRY
REMEMBERING
SUDDENLY
WAS
FLYING
UNCLE
VERNON
NEARLY
CRASHED
INTO
THE
CAR
IN
FRONT
HE
TURNED
AROUND
IN
HIS
SEAT
AND
YELLED
AT
HARRY
HIS
FACE
LIKE
A
GIGANTIC
WITH
A
MUSTACHE
"MOTORCYCLES
DON'T
FLY
DUDLEY
AND
PIERS
SNIGGERED
I
KNOW
THEY
DON'T
"
SAID
HARRY
"IT
WAS
ONLY
A
DREAM
BUT
HE
WISHED
HE
HADN'T
SAID
ANYTHING
IF
THERE
WAS
ONE
THING
DURSLEYS
HATED
EVEN
MORE
THAN
HIS
ASKING
QUESTIONS
IT
WAS
HIS
ABOUT
ANYTHING
ACTING
IN
A
WAY
IT
SHOULDN'T
NO
MATTER
IF
IT
WAS
IN
DREAM
OR
EVEN
A
CARTOON
THEY
SEEMED
TO
THINK
HE
MIGHT
GET
IDEAS
IT
WAS
A
VERY
SUNNY
SATURDAY
AND
THE
ZOO
WAS
CROWDED
WITH
FAMILIES
DURSLEYS
BOUGHT
DUDLEY
AND
PIERS
LARGE
CHOCOLATE
ICE
CREAMS
AT
ENTRANCE
AND
THEN
BECAUSE
THE
SMILING
LADY
IN
THE
VAN
HAD
ASKED
WHAT
HE
WANTED
BEFORE
THEY
COULD
HURRY
HIM
AWAY
THEY
BOUGHT
HIM
A
LEMON
ICE
POP
IT
WASN'T
BAD
EITHER
HARRY
THOUGHT
LICKING
IT
AS
WATCHED
A
GORILLA
SCRATCHING
ITS
HEAD
WHO
LOOKED
REMARKABLY
LIKE
DUDLEY
EXCEPT
THAT
IT
WASN'T
BLOND
HARRY
HAD
THE
BEST
MORNING
HE'D
HAD
IN
A
LONG
TIME
HE
WAS
CAREFUL
WALK
A
LITTLE
WAY
APART
FROM
THE
DURSLEYS
SO
THAT
DUDLEY
AND
PIERS
WERE
STARTING
TO
GET
BORED
WITH
THE
ANIMALS
BY
LUNCHTIME
WOULDN'T
BACK
ON
THEIR
FAVORITE
HOBBY
OF
HITTING
HIM
THEY
ATE
IN
THE
RESTAURANT
AND
WHEN
DUDLEY
HAD
A
TANTRUM
BECAUSE
HIS
GLORY
DIDN'T
HAVE
ENOUGH
ICE
CREAM
ON
TOP
UNCLE
VERNON
BOUGHT
ANOTHER
ONE
AND
HARRY
WAS
ALLOWED
TO
FINISH
THE
FIRST
HARRY
FELT
AFTERWARD
THAT
HE
SHOULD
HAVE
KNOWN
IT
WAS
ALL
TOO
GOOD
LAST
AFTER
LUNCH
THEY
WENT
TO
THE
REPTILE
HOUSE
IT
WAS
COOL
AND
DARK
THERE
WITH
LIT
WINDOWS
ALL
ALONG
THE
WALLS
BEHIND
THE
GLASS
ALL
OF
LIZARDS
AND
SNAKES
WERE
CRAWLING
AND
SLITHERING
OVER
BITS
OF
WOOD
STONE
DUDLEY
AND
PIERS
WANTED
TO
SEE
HUGE
POISONOUS
COBRAS
AND
THICK
MAN
CRUSHING
PYTHONS
DUDLEY
QUICKLY
FOUND
THE
LARGEST
SNAKE
IN
PLACE
IT
COULD
HAVE
WRAPPED
ITS
BODY
TWICE
AROUND
UNCLE
VERNON'S
AND
CRUSHED
IT
INTO
A
TRASH
CAN
BUT
AT
THE
MOMENT
IT
DIDN'T
LOOK
THE
MOOD
IN
FACT
IT
WAS
FAST
ASLEEP
DUDLEY
STOOD
WITH
HIS
NOSE
PRESSED
AGAINST
THE
GLASS
STARING
AT
GLISTENING
BROWN
COILS
"MAKE
IT
MOVE
"
HE
WHINED
AT
HIS
FATHER
UNCLE
VERNON
TAPPED
ON
GLASS
BUT
THE
SNAKE
DIDN'T
BUDGE
"DO
IT
AGAIN
"
DUDLEY
ORDERED
UNCLE
VERNON
RAPPED
THE
GLASS
WITH
HIS
KNUCKLES
BUT
THE
SNAKE
JUST
SNOOZED
ON
"THIS
IS
BORING
"
DUDLEY
MOANED
HE
SHUFFLED
AWAY
HARRY
MOVED
IN
FRONT
OF
THE
TANK
AND
LOOKED
INTENTLY
AT
THE
SNAKE
WOULDN'T
HAVE
BEEN
SURPRISED
IF
IT
HAD
DIED
OF
BOREDOM
ITSELF
COMPANY
EXCEPT
STUPID
PEOPLE
DRUMMING
THEIR
FINGERS
ON
THE
GLASS
TO
DISTURB
IT
ALL
DAY
LONG
IT
WAS
WORSE
THAN
HAVING
A
CUPBOARD
AS
BEDROOM
WHERE
THE
ONLY
VISITOR
WAS
AUNT
PETUNIA
HAMMERING
ON
THE
TO
WAKE
YOU
UP
AT
LEAST
HE
GOT
TO
VISIT
THE
REST
OF
THE
HOUSE
THE
SNAKE
SUDDENLY
OPENED
ITS
BEADY
EYES
SLOWLY
VERY
SLOWLY
IT
ITS
HEAD
UNTIL
ITS
EYES
WERE
ON
A
LEVEL
WITH
HARRY'S
IT
WINKED
HARRY
STARED
THEN
HE
LOOKED
QUICKLY
AROUND
TO
SEE
IF
ANYONE
WATCHING
THEY
WEREN'T
HE
LOOKED
BACK
AT
THE
SNAKE
AND
WINKED
TOO
THE
SNAKE
JERKED
ITS
HEAD
TOWARD
UNCLE
VERNON
AND
DUDLEY
THEN
ITS
EYES
TO
THE
CEILING
IT
GAVE
HARRY
A
LOOK
THAT
SAID
QUITE
PLAINLY
"I
GET
THAT
ALL
THE
TIME
"I
KNOW
"
HARRY
MURMURED
THROUGH
THE
GLASS
THOUGH
HE
WASN'T
SURE
SNAKE
COULD
HEAR
HIM
"IT
MUST
BE
REALLY
ANNOYING
THE
SNAKE
NODDED
VIGOROUSLY
"WHERE
DO
YOU
COME
FROM
ANYWAY
"
HARRY
ASKED
THE
SNAKE
JABBED
ITS
TAIL
AT
A
LITTLE
SIGN
NEXT
TO
THE
GLASS
PEERED
AT
IT
BOA
CONSTRICTOR
BRAZIL
"WAS
IT
NICE
THERE
THE
BOA
CONSTRICTOR
JABBED
ITS
TAIL
AT
THE
SIGN
AGAIN
AND
HARRY
READ
ON
THIS
SPECIMEN
WAS
BRED
IN
THE
ZOO
"OH
I
SEE
SO
YOU'VE
NEVER
BEEN
BRAZIL
AS
THE
SNAKE
SHOOK
ITS
HEAD
A
DEAFENING
SHOUT
BEHIND
HARRY
MADE
BOTH
THEM
JUMP
"DUDLEY
MR
DURSLEY
COME
AND
LOOK
AT
THIS
SNAKE
YOU
WON'T
WHAT
IT'S
DOING
DUDLEY
CAME
WADDLING
TOWARD
THEM
AS
FAST
AS
HE
COULD
"OUT
OF
THE
WAY
YOU
"
HE
SAID
PUNCHING
HARRY
IN
THE
RIBS
CAUGHT
SURPRISE
HARRY
FELL
HARD
ON
THE
CONCRETE
FLOOR
WHAT
CAME
NEXT
SO
FAST
NO
ONE
SAW
HOW
IT
HAPPENED
ONE
SECOND
PIERS
AND
DUDLEY
LEANING
RIGHT
UP
CLOSE
TO
THE
GLASS
THE
NEXT
THEY
HAD
LEAPT
BACK
HOWLS
OF
HORROR
HARRY
SAT
UP
AND
GASPED
THE
GLASS
FRONT
OF
THE

RAPIDLY
OUT
ONTO
THE

PEOPLE
THROUGHOUT
THE

SCREAMED
STARTED
RUNNING
FOR
THE

AS
THE
SNAKE
SLID
SWIFTLY
PAST
HIM
HARRY
COULD
HAVE
SWORN
A
LOW
HISSING
VOICE
SAID
"BRAZIL
HERE
I
COME
THANKSSS
AMIGO
THE
KEEPER
OF
THE
REPTILE
HOUSE
WAS
IN
SHOCK
"BUT
THE

HE
KEPT
SAYING
"WHERE

THE
ZOO
DIRECTOR
HIMSELF
MADE
AUNT
PETUNIA
A
CUP
OF
STRONG
SWEET
WHILE
HE
APOLOGIZED
OVER

OVER
AGAIN
PIERS
AND
DUDLEY
COULD

AS
FAR
AS
HARRY
HAD
SEEN
THE
SNAKE
HADN'T
DONE

PLAYFULLY
AT
THEIR

AS
IT
PASSED
BUT
BY
THE
TIME
THEY
ALL
BACK
IN
UNCLE
VERNON'S
CAR
DUDLEY
WAS
TELLING
THEM
HOW
IT
NEARLY
BITTEN
OFF
HIS
LEG
WHILE
PIERS
WAS
SWEARING
IT
HAD
TRIED
SQUEEZE
HIM
TO
DEATH
BUT
WORST
OF
ALL
FOR
HARRY
AT
LEAST
WAS
CALMING
DOWN
ENOUGH
TO
SAY
"HARRY
WAS
TALKING
TO
IT
WEREN'T
YOU
HARRY
UNCLE
VERNON
WAITED
UNTIL
PIERS
WAS
SAFELY
OUT
OF
THE

STARTING
ON
HARRY
HE
WAS
SO
ANGRY
HE
COULD
HARDLY
SPEAK
HE
MANAGED
SAY
"GO
CUPBOARD
STAY
NO
MEALS
"
BEFORE
HE
COLLAPSED
INTO
CHAIR
AND
AUNT
PETUNIA
HAD
TO
RUN
AND
GET
HIM
A
LARGE
BRANDY
HARRY
LAY
IN
HIS
DARK
CUPBOARD
MUCH
LATER
WISHING
HE
HAD
A
WATCH
DIDN'T
KNOW
WHAT
TIME
IT
WAS
AND
HE
COULDN'T
BE
SURE
THE
DURSLEYS
ASLEEP
YET
UNTIL
THEY
WERE
HE
COULDN'T
RISK
SNEAKING
TO
THE
FOR
SOME
FOOD
HE'D
LIVED
WITH
THE
DURSLEYS
ALMOST
TEN
YEARS
TEN
MISERABLE
YEARS
LONG
AS
HE
COULD
REMEMBER
EVER
SINCE
HE'D
BEEN
A
BABY
AND
HIS
HAD
DIED
IN
THAT
CAR
CRASH
HE
COULDN'T
REMEMBER
BEING
IN
THE
CAR
HIS
PARENTS
HAD
DIED
SOMETIMES
WHEN
HE
STRAINED
HIS
MEMORY
DURING
HOURS
IN
HIS
CUPBOARD
HE
CAME
UP
WITH
A
STRANGE
VISION
A
FLASH
OF
GREEN
LIGHT
AND
A
BURN
ING
PAIN
ON
HIS
FOREHEAD
THIS
SUPPOSED
WAS
THE
CRASH
THOUGH
HE
COULDN'T
IMAGINE
WHERE
ALL
THE
LIGHT
CAME
FROM
HE
COULDN'T
REMEMBER
HIS
PARENTS
AT
ALL
HIS
AUNT
UNCLE
NEVER
SPOKE
ABOUT
THEM
AND
OF
COURSE
HE
WAS
FORBIDDEN
TO
QUESTIONS
THERE
WERE
NO
PHOTOGRAPHS
OF
THEM
IN
THE
HOUSE
WHEN
HE
HAD
BEEN
YOUNGER
HARRY
HAD
DREAMED
AND
DREAMED
OF
SOME
RELATION
COMING
TO
TAKE
HIM
AWAY
BUT
IT
HAD
NEVER
HAPPENED
DURSLEYS
WERE
HIS
ONLY
FAMILY
YET
SOMETIMES
HE
THOUGHT
(OR
MAYBE
THAT
STRANGERS
IN
THE
STREET
SEEMED
TO
KNOW
HIM
VERY
STRANGE
THEY
WERE
TOO
A
TINY
MAN
IN
A
VIOLET
TOP
HAT
HAD
BOWED
TO
HIM
WHILE
OUT
SHOPPING
WITH
AUNT
PETUNIA
AND
DUDLEY
AFTER
ASKING
FURIOUSLY
IF
HE
KNEW
THE
MAN
AUNT
PETUNIA
HAD
RUSHED
THEM
OUT
OF
SHOP
WITHOUT
BUYING
ANYTHING
A
WILD
LOOKING
OLD
WOMAN
DRESSED
ALL
GREEN
HAD
WAVED
MERRILY
AT
HIM
ONCE
ON
A
BUS
A
BALD
MAN
IN
A
VERY
PURPLE
COAT
HAD
ACTUALLY
SHAKEN
HIS
HAND
IN
THE
STREET
THE
OTHER
DAY
THEN
WALKED
AWAY
WITHOUT
A
WORD
THE
WEIRDEST
THING
ABOUT
ALL
PEOPLE
WAS
THE
WAY
THEY
SEEMED
TO
VANISH
THE
SECOND
HARRY
TRIED
TO
GET
CLOSER
LOOK
AT
SCHOOL
HARRY
HAD
NO
ONE
EVERYBODY
KNEW
THAT
DUDLEY'S
GANG
THAT
ODD
HARRY
POTTER
IN
HIS
BAGGY
OLD
CLOTHES
AND
BROKEN
GLASSES
NOBODY
LIKED
TO
DISAGREE
WITH
DUDLEY'S
GANG
CHAPTER
THE
LETTERS
FROM
NO
THE
ESCAPE
OF
THE
BRAZILIAN
BOA
CONSTRICTOR
EARNED
HARRY
LONGEST
EVER
PUNISHMENT
BY
THE
TIME
HE
WAS
ALLOWED
OUT
OF
HIS
AGAIN
THE
SUMMER
HOLIDAYS
HAD
STARTED
AND
DUDLEY
HAD
ALREADY
BROKEN
NEW
VIDEO
CAMERA
CRASHED
HIS
REMOTE
CONTROL
AIRPLANE
AND
FIRST
OUT
ON
HIS
RACING
BIKE
KNOCKED
DOWN
OLD
MRS
FIGG
AS
SHE
CROSSED
DRIVE
ON
HER
CRUTCHES
HARRY
WAS
GLAD
SCHOOL
WAS
OVER
BUT
THERE
WAS
NO
ESCAPING
DUDLEY'S
GANG
WHO
VISITED
THE
HOUSE
EVERY
SINGLE
DAY
PIERS
DENNIS
MALCOLM
GORDON
WERE
ALL
BIG
AND
STUPID
BUT
AS
DUDLEY
WAS
THE
BIGGEST
STUPIDEST
OF
THE
LOT
HE
WAS
THE
LEADER
THE
REST
OF
THEM
WERE
ALL
HAPPY
TO
JOIN
IN
DUDLEY'S
FAVORITE
SPORT
HARRY
HUNTING
THIS
WAS
WHY
HARRY
SPENT
AS
MUCH
TIME
AS
POSSIBLE
OUT
OF
THE
HOUSE
WANDERING
AROUND
AND
THINKING
ABOUT
THE
END
OF
THE
HOLIDAYS
WHERE
COULD
SEE
A
TINY
RAY
OF
HOPE
WHEN
SEPTEMBER
CAME
HE
WOULD
BE
GOING
TO
SECONDARY
SCHOOL
AND
FOR
THE
FIRST
TIME
IN
HIS
LIFE
HE
WOULDN'T
WITH
DUDLEY
DUDLEY
HAD
BEEN
ACCEPTED
AT
UNCLE
VERNON'S
OLD
SCHOOL
SMELTINGS
PIERS
POLKISS
WAS
GOING
THERE
TOO
HARRY
ON
OTHER
HAND
WAS
GOING
TO
STONEWALL
HIGH
THE
LOCAL
PUBLIC
SCHOOL
THOUGHT
THIS
WAS
VERY
FUNNY
"THEY
STUFF
PEOPLE'S
HEADS
DOWN
THE
TOILET
THE
FIRST
DAY
AT
STONEWALL
HE
TOLD
HARRY
"WANT
TO
COME
UPSTAIRS
AND
PRACTICE
"NO
THANKS
"
SAID
HARRY
"THE
POOR
TOILET'S
NEVER
HAD
ANYTHING
HORRIBLE
AS
YOUR
HEAD
DOWN
IT
IT
MIGHT
BE
SICK
"
THEN
HE
RAN
DUDLEY
COULD
WORK
OUT
WHAT
HE'D
SAID
ONE
DAY
IN
JULY
AUNT
PETUNIA
TOOK
DUDLEY
TO
LONDON
TO
BUY
HIS
UNIFORM
LEAVING
HARRY
AT
MRS
FIGG'S
MRS
FIGG
WASN
'T
AS
BAD
USUAL
IT
TURNED
OUT
SHE'D
BROKEN
HER
LEG
TRIPPING
OVER
ONE
OF
HER
CATS
AND
SHE
DIDN'T
SEEM
QUITE
AS
FOND
OF
THEM
AS
BEFORE
SHE
LET
HARRY
TELEVISION
AND
GAVE
HIM
A
BIT
OF
CHOCOLATE
CAKE
THAT
TASTED
AS
SHE'D
HAD
IT
FOR
SEVERAL
YEARS
THAT
EVENING
DUDLEY
PARADED
AROUND
THE
LIVING

FOR
THE

USED
FOR
HITTING
EACH
OTHER
WHILE
THE
TEACHERS
LOOKING
THIS
WAS
SUPPOSED
TO
BE
GOOD
TRAINING
FOR
LATER
LIFE
AS
HE
LOOKED
AT
DUDLEY
IN
HIS
NEW
KNICKERBOCKERS
UNCLE
VERNON
GRUFFLY
THAT
IT
WAS
THE
PROUDEST
MOMENT
OF
HIS
LIFE
AUNT
PETUNIA
INTO
TEARS
AND
SAID
SHE
COULDN'T
BELIEVE
IT
WAS
HER
ICKLE
DUDLEYKINS
LOOKED
SO
HANDSOME
AND
GROWN
UP
HARRY
DIDN'T
TRUST
HIMSELF
TO
SPEAK
THOUGHT
TWO
OF
HIS
RIBS
MIGHT
ALREADY
HAVE
CRACKED
FROM
TRYING
NOT
LAUGH
THERE
WAS
A
HORRIBLE
SMELL
IN
THE
KITCHEN
THE
NEXT
MORNING
WHEN
WENT
IN
FOR
BREAKFAST
IT
SEEMED
TO
BE
COMING
FROM
A
LARGE
METAL
TUB
THE
SINK
HE
WENT
TO
HAVE
A
LOOK
THE
TUB
WAS
FULL
OF
WHAT
LOOKED
DIRTY
RAGS
SWIMMING
IN
GRAY
WATER
"WHAT'S
THIS
"
HE
ASKED
AUNT
PETUNIA
HER
LIPS
TIGHTENED
AS
THEY
DID
IF
HE
DARED
TO
ASK
A
QUESTION
"YOUR
NEW
SCHOOL
UNIFORM
"
SHE
SAID
HARRY
LOOKED
IN
THE
BOWL
AGAIN
"OH

HE
SAID
"I
DIDN'T
REALIZE
IT
HAD
TO
BE
SO
WET
"DOTA

SNAPPED
AUNT
PETUNIA
"I'M

IT'LL
LOOK
JUST
LIKE
EVERYONE

HARRY
SERIOUSLY
DOUBTED
THIS
BUT
THOUGHT
IT
BEST
NOT
TO
ARGUE
HE
DOWN
AT
THE
TABLE
AND
TRIED
NOT
TO
THINK
ABOUT
HOW
HE
WAS
GOING
TO
ON
HIS
FIRST
DAY
AT
STONEWALL
HIGH
LIKE
HE
WAS
WEARING
BITS
OF
ELEPHANT
SKIN
PROBABLY
DUDLEY
AND
UNCLE
VERNON
CAME
IN
BOTH
WITH
WRINKLED
NOSES
BECAUSE
OF
SMELL
FROM
HARRY'S
NEW
UNIFORM
UNCLE
VERNON
OPENED
HIS
NEWSPAPER
USUAL
AND
DUDLEY
BANGED
HIS
SMELTING

WHICH
HE
CARRIED
EVERYWHERE
ON
THE

THEY
HEARD
THE
CLICK
OF
THE

EVER
IN
HIS
WHOLE
LIFE
HAD
WRITTEN
TO
HIM
WOULD
HE
HAD
NO
FRIENDS
NO
OTHER

HE
DIDN'T
BELONG

GLANCING
AT

LEANED
OVER

HARRY
WAS
SURE
AND
HE
LEANED
FORWARD
EAGERLY
EXPECTING
TO

AT

HE
THOUGHT
IT
WAS

PICKED
IT
UP
AND
TUCKED
IT
DEEP
INSIDE

LONGED
TO
KNOW
WHAT
IT
WAS

KNEW
BETTER
THAN
TO
ASK
"COME

DRACO
MALFOY
	STILL
FIRST
GRYFFINDORS

HE'D

LITTIE
FROM

MALFOY
COULDN'T

THE
NEXT

LOOKING
TIRED

PERFECTLY
CHEERFUL
INDEED
BY
THE
NEXT

HARRY

THAT

EITHER
REALLY
VALUABLE

REALLY
DANGEROUS

AS
ALL
THEY
KNEW
FOR

ABOUT
THE
MYSTERIOUS
OBJECT
WAS
THAT
WAS
ABOUT
TWO
INCHES
LONG
THEY
DIDN'T
HAVE
MUCH
CHANCE
OF
GUESSING
IT
WAS
WITHOUT
FURTHER
CLUES
NEITHER
NEVILLE

HERMIONE
SHOWED
THE
SLIGHTEST
INTEREST
IN
WHAT
UNDERNEATH
THE

ALL
NEVILLE
CARED
ABOUT
WAS
GOING

BOSSY

IT
ALL
THAT
THEY
SAW
THIS
AS
AN

BONUS
ALL
THEY
WANTED
NOW
WAS
A
WAY
OF
GETTING
BACK
AT

IT'S
THE

AN

THEY
WOULD
MOVE
UP
INTO

ALSO
TENT
HIM

THROUGH
THE

HARRY
LEARNED
THAT
THERE
WERE
SEVEN
HUNDRED
WAYS
OF

QUIDDITCH
FOUL
AND
THAT
ALL
OF
THEM
HAD
HAPPENED
DURING
A

MOST
SERIOUS

THAT
ALTHOUGH

REFEREES
BEEN
KNOWN
TO
VANISH
AND

UP
MONTHS
LATER
IN
THE
SAHARA
DESERT
HERMIONE
HAD
BECOME
A
BIT
MORE
RELAXED
ABOUT
BREAKING
RULES
SINCE
AND
RON
HAD
SAVED
HER
FROM
THE
MOUNTAIN
TROLL
AND
SHE
WAS
MUCH
FOR
IT
THE

CARRIED
AROUND
IN
A
JAM
JAR
THEY
WERE
STANDING
WITH
THEIR

GETTING
WARM
WHEN
CROSSED
THE

HARRY
NOTICED
AT

THAT
SNAPE
WAS
LIMPING
HARRY
RON
AND
HERMIONE
MOVED
CLOSER
TOGETHER
TO
BLOCK
THE
FIRE
FROM
VIEW
THEY
WERE
SURE
IT
WOULDN'T
BE
ALLOWED
UNFORTUNATELY
SOMETHING
THEIR
GUILTY
FACES
CAUGHT
SNAPE'S
EYE
HE
LIMPED
OVER
HE
HADN'T
THE
FIRE
BUT
HE
SEEMED
TO
BE
LOOKING
FOR
A
REASON
TO
TELL
THEM
ANYWAY
"WHAT'S
THAT
YOU'VE
GOT
THERE
POTTER
IT
WAS
QUIDDITCH
THROUGH
THE
AGES
HARRY
SHOWED
HIM

HARRY
MUTTERED

GOT
THE

ANYWAY
HARRY
FELT
RESTLESS
HE
WANTED
QUIDDITCH
THROUGH
THE
AGES
BACK
TO
HIS

OFF
HIS
NERVES
ABOUT
TOMORROW
WHY
SHOULD
HE
BE
AFRAID
SNAPE
GETTING

HE
TOLD
RON
AND
HERMIONE
HE
WAS
GOING
TO
ASK
SNAPE
HE
COULD
HAVE
IT
"BETTER

THEY
SAID
TOGETHER
BUT
HARRY
HAD
AN
IDEA
SNAPE
WOULDN'T
REFUSE
IF
THERE
WERE
OTHER

MADE
HIS
WAY
DOWN

BLOSSOMING
OUT
OF
HIS

TRAILING
THEM
OVER
THE

OF
THE

HAGRID
FOLLOWING
THEM
OUT
OF
THE

"JUST
THE

HARRY
TOLD
HIM
BRIGHTLY
"EVER

"UNLESS

HARRY
ADDED
MUST'VE
BEEN
THROUGH
HUNDREDS
OF
BOOKS
ALREADY
AND
WE
CAN'T
FIND
ANYWHERE
JUST
GIVE
US
A
HINT
I
KNOW
I'VE
READ
HIS
NAME
SOMEWHERE
"I'M
SAYIN'
NOTHIN
SAID
HAGRID
FLATLY
"JUST
HAVE
TO
FIND
OUT
FOR
OURSELVES
THEN
"
SAID
RON
AND
THEY
HAGRID
LOOKING
DISGRUNTLED
AND
HURRIED
OFF
TO
THE
LIBRARY
THEY
HAD
INDEED
BEEN
SEARCHING
BOOKS
FOR
FLAMEL'S
NAME
EVER
SINCE
HAD
LET
IT
SLIP
BECAUSE
HOW
ELSE
WERE
THEY
GOING
TO
FIND
OUT
WHAT
WAS
TRYING
TO
STEAL
THE
TROUBLE
WAS
IT
WAS
VERY
HARD
TO
KNOW
WHERE
BEGIN
NOT
KNOWING
WHAT
FLAMEL
MIGHT
HAVE
DONE
TO
GET
HIMSELF
INTO
BOOK
HE
WASN'T
IN
GREAT
WIZARDS
OF
THE
TWENTIETH
CENTURY
OR
MAGICAL
NAMES
OF
OUR
TIME
HE
WAS
MISSING
TOO
FROM
IMPORTANT
MAGICAL
DISCOVERIES
AND
A
STUDY
OF
RECENT
DEVELOPMENTS
IN
WIZARDRY
THEN
OF
COURSE
THERE
WAS
THE
SHEER
SIZE
OF
THE

TENS
THOUSANDS
OF

THOUSANDS
OF

HUNDREDS
OF
NARROW

HERMIONE
TOOK
OUT
A
LIST
OF
SUBJECTS
AND
TITLES
SHE
HAD
DECIDED
SEARCH
WHILE
RON
STRODE
OFF
DOWN
A
ROW
OF
BOOKS
AND
STARTED
PULLING
OFF
THE
SHELVES
AT
RANDOM
HARRY
WANDERED
OVER
TO
THE
SECTION
HE
HAD
BEEN
WONDERING
FOR
A
WHILE
IF
FLAMEL
WASN'T
SOMEWHERE
THERE
UNFORTUNATELY
YOU
NEEDED
A
SPECIALLY
SIGNED
NOTE
FROM
ONE
OF
TEACHERS
TO
LOOK
IN
ANY
OF
THE
RESTRICTED
BOOKS
AND
HE
KNEW
HE'D
GET
ONE
THESE
WERE
THE
BOOKS
CONTAINING
POWERFUL
DARK
MAGIC
TAUGHT
AT
HOGWARTS
AND
ONLY
READ
BY
OLDER

"WHAT
ARE
YOU
LOOKING
FOR

"NOTHING

SAID
HARRY
MADAM
PINCE
THE
LIBRARIAN
BRANDISHED
A
FEATHER
DUSTER
AT
HIM
"YOU'D
BETTER
GET
OUT
THEN
GO
ON
OUT
WISHING
HE'D
BEEN
A
BIT
QUICKER
AT
THINKING
UP
SOME
STORY
HARRY
THE
LIBRARY
HE
RON
AND
HERMIONE
HAD
ALREADY
AGREED
THEY'D
BETTER
ASK
MADAM
PINCE
WHERE
THEY
COULD
FIND
FLAMEL
THEY
WERE
SURE
SHE'D
ABLE
TO
TELL
THEM
BUT
THEY
COULDN'T
RISK
SNAPE
HEARING
WHAT
THEY
UP
TO
HARRY
WAITED
OUTSIDE
IN
THE
CORRIDOR
TO
SEE
IF
THE
OTHER
TWO
HAD
ANYTHING
BUT
HE
WASN'T
VERY
HOPEFUL
THEY
HAD
BEEN
LOOKING
FOR
WEEKS
AFTER
A
BUT
AS
THEY
ONLY
HAD
ODD
MOMENTS
BETWEEN
LESSONS
WASN'T
SURPRISING
THEY'D
FOUND
NOTHING
WHAT
THEY
REALLY
NEEDED
WAS
NICE
LONG
SEARCH
WITHOUT
MADAM
PINCE
BREATHING
DOWN
THEIR
NECKS
FIVE
MINUTES
LATER
RON
AND
HERMIONE
JOINED
HIM
SHAKING
THEIR
HEADS
THEY
WENT
OFF
TO
LUNCH
"YOU
WILL
KEEP
LOOKING
WHILE
I'M
AWAY
WON'T
YOU
"
SAID
HERMIONE
SEND
ME
AN
OWL
IF
YOU
FIND
ANYTHING
"AND
YOU
COULD
ASK
YOUR
PARENTS
IF
THEY
KNOW
WHO
FLAMEL
IS
"
SAID
RON
"IT'D
BE
SAFE
TO
ASK
THEM
"VERY
SAFE
AS
THEY'RE
BOTH
DENTISTS
"
SAID
HERMIONE
ONCE
THE
HOLIDAYS
HAD
STARTED
RON
AND
HARRY
WERE
HAVING
TOO
GOOD
A
TO
THINK
MUCH
ABOUT
FLAMEL
THEY
HAD
THE
DORMITORY
TO
THEMSELVES
AND
COMMON
ROOM
WAS
FAR
EMPTIER
THAN
USUAL
SO
THEY
WERE
ABLE
TO
GET
GOOD
ARMCHAIRS
BY
THE
FIRE
THEY
SAT
BY
THE
HOUR
EATING
ANYTHING
COULD
SPEAR
ON

RON
ALSO
STARTED
TEACHING
HARRY
WIZARD

THIS
WAS
EXACTLY
MUGGLE
CHESS

THAT
THE

WERE
ALIVE

MADE
IT
A
LIKE
DIRECTING

BOOKS
AS
THOUGH
THEY
KNEW
SOMEONE
WAS
THERE
WHO
SHOULDN'T
BE
HE
HAD
TO
START
SOMEWHERE
SETTING
THE
LAMP
DOWN
CAREFULLY
ON
THE
FLOOR
HE
LOOKED
ALONG
THE
BOTTOM
SHELF
FOR
AN
INTERESTINGLOOKING
BOOK
A
BLACK
AND
SILVER
VOLUME
CAUGHT
HIS
EYE
HE
PULLED
IT
OUT
DIFFICULTY
BECAUSE
IT
WAS
VERY
HEAVY
AND
BALANCING
IT
ON
HIS
KNEE
LET
IT
FALL
OPEN
A
PIERCING
BLOODCURDLING
SHRIEK
SPLIT
THE
SILENCE
THE
BOOK
SCREAMING
HARRY
SNAPPED
IT
SHUT
BUT
THE
SHRIEK
WENT
ON
AND
ON
HIGH
UNBROKEN
EARSPLITTING
NOTE
HE
STUMBLED
BACKWARD
AND
KNOCKED
HIS
LAMP
WHICH
WENT
OUT
AT
ONCE
PANICKING
HE
HEARD
FOOTSTEPS
DOWN
THE
CORRIDOR
OUTSIDE
STUFFING
THE
SHRIEKING
BOOK
BACK
ON
SHELF
HE
RAN
FOR
IT
HE
PASSED
FILCH
IN
THE
DOORWAY
FILCH'S
PALE
EYES
LOOKED
STRAIGHT
THROUGH
HIM
AND
HARRY
SLIPPED
UNDER
OUTSTRETCHED
ARM
AND
STREAKED
OFF
UP
THE
CORRIDOR
THE
BOOK'S
STILL
RINGING
IN
HIS
EARS
HE
CAME
TO
A
SUDDEN
HALT
IN
FRONT
OF
A
TALL
SUIT
OF
ARMOR
HE
HAD
SO
BUSY
GETTING
AWAY
FROM
THE
LIBRARY
HE
HADN'T
PAID
ATTENTION
TO
HE
WAS
GOING
PERHAPS
BECAUSE
IT
WAS
DARK
HE
DIDN'T
RECOGNIZE
WHERE
WAS
AT
ALL
THERE
WAS
A
SUIT
OF
ARMOR
NEAR
THE
KITCHENS
HE
KNEW
BUT
MUST
BE
FIVE
FLOORS
ABOVE
THERE
"YOU
ASKED
ME
TO
COME
DIRECTLY
TO
YOU
PROFESSOR
IF
ANYONE
WANDERING
AROUND
AT
NIGHT
AND
SOMEBODY'S
BEEN
IN

LIBRARY
SECTION
HARRY
FELT
THE
BLOOD
DRAIN
OUT
OF
HIS
FACE
WHEREVER
HE
WAS
FILCH
KNOW
A
SHORTCUT
BECAUSE
HIS
SOFT
GREASY
VOICE
WAS
GETTING
NEARER
TO
HIS
HORROR
IT
WAS
SNAPE
WHO
REPLIED
"THE
RESTRICTED
SECTION
WELL
THEY
CAN'T
BE
FAR
WE'LL
CATCH
THEM
HARRY
STOOD
ROOTED
TO
THE
SPOT
AS
FILCH
AND
SNAPE
CAME
AROUND
THE
AHEAD
THEY
COULDN'T
SEE
HIM
OF
COURSE
BUT
IT
WAS
A
NARROW
AND
IF
THEY
CAME
MUCH
NEARER
THEY'D
KNOCK
RIGHT
INTO
HIM
THE
DIDN'T
STOP
HIM
FROM
BEING
SOLID
HE
BACKED
AWAY
AS
QUIETLY
AS
HE
COULD
A
DOOR
STOOD
AJAR
TO
HIS
LEFT
WAS
HIS
ONLY
HOPE
HE
SQUEEZED
THROUGH
IT
HOLDING
HIS
BREATH
NOT
TO
MOVE
IT
AND
TO
HIS
RELIEF
HE
MANAGED
TO
GET
INSIDE
THE
WITHOUT
THEIR
NOTICING
ANYTHING
THEY
WALKED
STRAIGHT
PAST
AND
LEANED
AGAINST
THE
WALL
BREATHING
DEEPLY
LISTENING
TO
THEIR
DYING
AWAY
THAT
HAD
BEEN
CLOSE
VERY
CLOSE
IT
WAS
A
FEW
SECONDS
HE
NOTICED
ANYTHING
ABOUT
THE
ROOM
HE
HAD
HIDDEN
IN
IT
LOOKED
LIKE
AN
UNUSED
CLASSROOM
THE
DARK
SHAPES
OF
DESKS
AND
WERE
PILED
AGAINST
THE
WALLS
AND
THERE
WAS
AN
UPTURNED
BASKET
BUT
PROPPED
AGAINST
THE
WALL
FACING
HIM
WAS
SOMETHING
DIDN'T
LOOK
AS
IF
IT
BELONGED
THERE
SOMETHING
THAT
LOOKED
AS
IF
HAD
JUST
PUT
IT
THERE
TO
KEEP
IT
OUT
OF
THE
WAY
IT
WAS
A
MAGNIFICENT
MIRROR
AS
HIGH
AS
THE
CEILING
WITH
AN
ORNATE
FRAME
STANDING
ON
TWO
CLAWED
FEET
THERE
WAS
AN
INSCRIPTION
AROUND
THE
TOP
ERISED
STRA
EHRU
OYT
UBE
CAFRU
OYT
ON
WOHSI
HIS
FADING
NOW
THAT
THERE
WAS
NO
SOUND
OF

AND
SNAPE
HARRY
NEARER
TO
THE
MIRROR
WANTING
TO
LOOK
AT
HIMSELF
BUT
SEE
NO
AGAIN
HE
STEPPED
IN
FRONT
OF
IT
HE
HAD
TO
CLAP
HIS
HANDS
TO
HIS
MOUTH
TO
STOP
HIMSELF
FROM
SCREAMING
WHIRLED
AROUND
HIS
HEART
WAS
POUNDING
FAR
MORE
FURIOUSLY
THAN
WHEN
BOOK
HAD
SCREAMED
FOR
HE
HAD
SEEN
NOT
ONLY
HIMSELF
IN
THE
MIRROR
A
WHOLE
CROWD
OF
PEOPLE
STANDING
RIGHT
BEHIND
HIM
BUT
THE
ROOM
WAS
EMPTY
BREATHING
VERY
FAST
HE
TURNED
SLOWLY
BACK
THE
MIRROR
THERE
HE
WAS
REFLECTED
IN
IT
WHITE
AND
SCARED
LOOKING
AND
THERE
REFLECTED
BEHIND
HIM
WERE
AT
LEAST
TEN
OTHERS
HARRY
LOOKED
OVER
SHOULDER
BUT
STILL
NO
ONE
WAS
THERE
OR
WERE
THEY
ALL
INVISIBLE
TOO
WAS
HE
IN
FACT
IN
A
ROOM
FULL
OF
INVISIBLE
PEOPLE
AND
THIS
TRICK
WAS
THAT
IT
REFLECTED
THEM
INVISIBLE
OR
NOT
HE
LOOKED
IN
THE
MIRROR
AGAIN
A
WOMAN
STANDING
RIGHT
BEHIND
REFLECTION
WAS
SMILING
AT
HIM
AND
WAVING
HE
REACHED
OUT
A
HAND
AND
THE
AIR
BEHIND
HIM
IF
SHE
WAS
REALLY
THERE
HE'D
TOUCH
HER
REFLECTIONS
WERE
SO
CLOSE
TOGETHER
BUT
HE
FELT
ONLY
AIR
SHE
AND
OTHERS
EXISTED
ONLY
IN
THE
MIRROR
SHE
WAS
A
VERY
PRETTY
WOMAN
SHE
HAD
DARK
RED
HAIR
AND
HER
EYES
EYES
ARE
JUST
LIKE
MINE
HARRY
THOUGHT
EDGING
A
LITTLE
CLOSER
TO
GLASS
BRIGHT
GREEN
EXACTLY
THE
SAME
SHAPE
BUT
THEN
HE
NOTICED
SHE
WAS
CRYING
SMILING
BUT
CRYING
AT
THE
SAME
TIME
THE
TALL
THIN
BLACK
HAIRED
MAN
STANDING
NEXT
TO
HER
PUT
HIS
ARM
AROUND
HER
HE
GLASSES
AND
HIS
HAIR
WAS
VERY
UNTIDY
IT
STUCK
UP
AT
THE
BACK
JUST
HARRY'S
DID
HARRY
WAS
SO
CLOSE
TO
THE
MIRROR
NOW
THAT
HIS
NOSE
WAS
NEARLY
THAT
OF
HIS
REFLECTION
"MOM
"
HE
WHISPERED
"DAD
THEY
JUST
LOOKED
AT
HIM
SMILING
AND
SLOWLY
HARRY
LOOKED
INTO
FACES
OF
THE
OTHER
PEOPLE
IN
THE
MIRROR
AND
SAW
OTHER
PAIRS
OF
EYES
LIKE
HIS
OTHER
NOSES
LIKE
HIS
EVEN
A
LITTLE
OLD
MAN
WHO
LOOKED
THOUGH
HE
HAD
HARRY'S
KNOBBLY
KNEES
HARRY
WAS
LOOKING
AT
HIS
FAMILY
FOR
THE
FIRST
TIME
IN
HIS
LIFE
THE
POTTERS
SMILED
AND
WAVED
AT
HARRY
AND
HE
STARED
HUNGRILY
BACK
THEM
HIS
HANDS
PRESSED
FLAT
AGAINST
THE
GLASS
AS
THOUGH
HE
WAS
TO
FALL
RIGHT
THROUGH
IT
AND
REACH
THEM
HE
HAD
A
POWERFUL
KIND
OF
INSIDE
HIM
HALF
JOY
HALF
TERRIBLE
SADNESS
HOW
LONG
HE
STOOD
THERE
HE
DIDN'T
KNOW
THE
REFLECTIONS
DID
NOT
AND
HE
LOOKED
AND
LOOKED
UNTIL
A
DISTANT
NOISE
BROUGHT
HIM
BACK
TO
SENSES
HE
COULDN'T
STAY
HERE
HE
HAD
TO
FIND
HIS
WAY
BACK
TO
BED

HIS
EYES
AWAY
FROM
HIS
MOTHER'S
FACE
WHISPERED
"I'LL

WHEN

IT
STRUCK
HARRY
THAT

NOT
HAVE
BEEN
QUITE
TRUTHFUL

THEN
HE
THOUGHT
AS

SCABBERS
OFF

IT
HAD
BEEN
QUITE
A
PERSONAL
QUESTION

NICOLAS
DUMBLEDORE
HAD
CONVINCED

FOLDED
AT

OF
HIS

HE
COULD
FORGET
WHAT
HE'D
SEEN
IN

AS
EASILY

COULDN'T
HE
STARTED
HAVING
NIGHTMARES
OVER
AND
OVER
AGAIN
HE
ABOUT
HIS

DISAPPEARING
IN
A
FLASH
OF
GREEN
LIGHT
WHILE
A
VOICE
CACKLED
WITH

RON
WHEN
HARRY
TOLD
HIM
ABOUT
THESE
DREARNS
HERMIONE
WHO
CAME
BACK
THE
DAY
BEFORE
TERM
STARTED
TOOK
A
VIEW
OF
THINGS
SHE
WAS
TORN
BETWEEN

AT
THE
IDEA
OF
HARRY
OUT
OF

ROAMING
THE

THEY
HAD
ALMOST
GIVEN
UP
HOPE
OF

SURE
HE'D
READ
THE

THEY
WERE
BACK
TO
SKIMMING
THROUGH

FOR
MINUTES
DURING
THEIR

A
BIT
OF
BAD
NEWS
HE'D
JUST
GOTTEN
VERY
ANGRY
WITH

WHO
KEPT
DIVE
BOMBING
EACH
OTHER
AND
PRETENDING
TO
FALL

BROOMS
"WILL

HE
YELLED
"THAT'S
EXACTLY
THE

THING
THAT'LL
LOSE

THE

REFEREEING
THIS
TIME
AND
BE
LOOKING

GEORGE
WEASLEY
REALLY
DID
FALL
OFF
HIS

AT
THESE

HE
SPLUTTERED
THROUGH
A
MOUTHFUL
OF

HE
EVER
REFEREED
A
QUIDDITCH

HE'S
NOT
GOING
TO
BE
FAIR
IF
MIGHT
OVERTAKE
SLYTHERIN
THE
REST
OF
THE

LANDED

TO
COMPLAIN
TOO
"IT'S
NOT
MY
FAULT
"
SAID
WOOD
"WE'VE
JUST
GOT
TO
MAKE
SURE

SO
SNAPE
HASN'T
GOT
AN

WHICH
WAS

VERY
WELL

HARRY

HE
HAD
ANOTHER

THOUGHT
WAS
GOOD
FOR

SAID

WHEN
HARRY
SAT
DOWN

HIM
"I

HE
CAUGHT
SIGHT
OF
HARRY'S
FACE
"WHAT'S

CHOKED

PULLED
OUT

GAVE
IT

SO
EXCITED
SINCE
GOTTEN
BACK
THE
MARKS
FOR
THEIR

FIRST

SHE
SAID
AND
SHE
SPRINTED
UP
THE

TO
THE
DORMITORIES
HARRY
AND

BARELY
HAD
TIME
TO

MYSTIFIED
BEFORE
SHE
WAS

BACK
AN
ENORMOUS
OLD

"I
NEVER

EXCITEDLY
"I

HERMIONE
TOLD

QUIET
UNTIL
SHE'D
SOMETHING
UP

STARTED
FLICKING
FRANTICALLY
THROUGH
THE

MUTTERING

SHE
FOUND
WHAT

WHISPERED
DRAMATICALLY
"IS

HAVE
BEEN
MANY

HERMIONE
WHEN
HARRY
AND

HAD
FINISHED
"THE

FLAMEL'S
SORCERER'S

I
BET
HE
ASKED

THEY'RE

HE
KNEW

THAT'S
WHY
HE
WANTED

OUT

"A

HARRY
WONDER
SNAPE'S
AFTER

ANYONE
WOULD
WANT
IT
"AND
NO

WE
COULDN'T

REMEMBERED
ABOUT

HE
TOLD

"IF
I
DON'T

I'M
JUST

AS
THE

DREW
NEARER
HOWEVER
HARRY
BECAME
MORE
AND
MORE
NERVOUS
WHATEVER
HE
TOLD
RON
AND
HERMIONE
THE
REST
OF
THE

WASN'T
TOO
CALM
EITHER
THE
IDEA
OF
OVERTAKING
SLYTHERIN
IN
THE
HOUSE
CHAMPIONSHIP
WONDERFUL
NO
ONE
HAD
DONE
IT
FOR
SEVEN
YEARS
BUT
WOULD
THEY
BE
TO
WITH
SUCH
A
BIASED
REFEREE
HARRY
DIDN'T
KNOW
WHETHER
HE
WAS
IMAGINING
IT
OR
NOT

HE
SEEMED

WENT
AT

EVEN
WHETHER

HIM
TRYING
TO

INTO
A

POSSIBLY
KNOW
THEY'D

HARRY
DIDN'T
SEE
HOW
HE
COULD
YET

SOMETIMES
THE
HORRIBLE
FEELING
THAT

HARRY
KNEW
WHEN
THEY
WISHED
HIM
GOOD
LUCK
OUTSIDE
THE

ROOMS
NEXT
AFTERNOON
THAT
RON
AND
HERMIONE
WERE
WONDERING
WHETHER
THEY'D

WASN'T
WHAT
YOU'D

HE
PULLED
ON

SO

WORRIED
WHY

TO
THE

LITTLE
DID
KNOW
THAT
RON
AND
HERMIONE
HAD
BEEN
SECRETLY
PRACTICING
THE

THEY'D
GOTTEN
THE

FROM

USING
IT
ON

READY
TO
USE
IT
ON

SHOWED
ANY

CRASHING
AWAY
THROUGH

SCARED
UNTIL

HARRY
SET
OFF
INTO

OF

WITH
MALFOY
AND
FANG
WALKED
FOR
NEARLY
HALF
AN
HOUR
DEEPER
AND
DEEPER
INTO
THE

THE

BECAME
ALMOST
IMPOSSIBLE
TO

BECAUSE

WERE
THICK
HARRY
THOUGHT
THE

TO

THICKER
THERE

ON

OF

AS
THOUGH
THE

AHEAD
THROUGH

HOLDING
OUT
HIS

TO
STOP

SOMETHING
BRIGHT
WHITE
WAS
GLEAMING
ON
THE
GROUND
THEY
INCHED
CLOSER
IT
WAS
THE
UNICORN
ALL
RIGHT

IT
WAS
DEAD
HARRY
HAD
NEVER

SO
BEAUTIFUL
AND
SAD
ITS
LONG

WERE
STUCK
OUT

WHERE
IT

ITS

HARRY
HAD
TAKEN
ONE
STEP
TOWARD

WHEN
A

SOUND
MADE
FREEZE
WHERE
HE
STOOD
A
BUSH
ON
THE
EDGE
OF
THE

QUIVERED
THEN
OUT
OF
THE

A
HOODED
FIGURE
CAME
CRAWLING
ACROSS
GROUND
LIKE
SOME
STALKING
BEAST
HARRY
MALFOY
AND
FANG
TRANSFIXED
THE

FIGURE
REACHED
THE

LOWERED
ITS
OVER

BEGAN
TO

ITS

"AAAAAAAAAARGH
MALFOY
LET
OUT
A
TERRIBLE
SCREAM
AND
BOLTED
SO
DID
FANG
THE
FIGURE
RAISED
ITS

LOOKED
RIGHT
AT
HARRY
UNICORN
BLOOD
DRIBBLING
DOWN
ITS

IT
GOT
TO
ITS

AND
CAME
SWIFTLY
HARRY
HE
COULDN'T
MOVE
FOR

THEN
A
PAIN
LIKE
HE'D
NEVER

BEFORE
PIERCED
HIS

WAS

HALF
BLINDED
HE
STAGGERED
BACKWARD
HEARD
HOOVES
BEHIND

GALLOPING
AND
SOMETHING
JUMPED
CLEAN
HARRY
CHARGING
AT
THE
FIGURE
THE
PAIN
IN
HARRY'S

WAS
SO
BAD
HE
FELL
TO
HIS

IT
TOOK
MINUTE
OR
TWO
TO

SAID
THE

PULLING
HARRY
TO
HIS

"YES

THE

DIDN'T

HE
HAD
ASTONISHINGLY
BLUE
EYES

CAREFULLY
AT

ON
THE
THAT
STOOD

ADDED
AS

LOWERED
HIMSELF
ON
TO
HIS

SO
THAT
HARRY
COULD
CLAMBER
ONTO

THERE
WAS
SUDDENLY
A
SOUND
OF
MORE
GALLOPING
FROM
THE

THAT
IT
WAS

WORSE

BECAUSE
WAS

IT
WAS

AROUND
HARRY'S

HARRY'S

WAS
ALMOST
BLINDING

HARRY
KNEW

WAS
TO
