THE
DEAD
BODIES
AFTER
THE
WHICH
A
PEAL
ORDNANCE
IS
SHOT
OFF
HARRY
POTTER
AND
THE
SORCERER'S
CHAPTER
THE
BOY
WHO
MR
AND
MRS
DURSLEY
OF
NUMBER
FOUR
PRIVET
DRIVE
WERE
PROUD
TO
THAT
THEY
WERE
PERFECTLY
NORMAL
THANK
YOU
VERY
MUCH
THEY
WERE
THE
PEOPLE
YOU'D
EXPECT
TO
BE
INVOLVED
IN
ANYTHING
STRANGE
OR
MYSTERIOUS
BECAUSE
THEY
JUST
DIDN'T
HOLD
WITH
SUCH
NONSENSE
MR
DURSLEY
WAS
THE
DIRECTOR
OF
A
FIRM
CALLED
GRUNNINGS
WHICH
DRILLS
HE
WAS
A
BIG
BEEFY
MAN
WITH
HARDLY
ANY
NECK
ALTHOUGH
HE
HAVE
A
VERY
LARGE
MUSTACHE
MRS
DURSLEY
WAS
THIN
AND
BLONDE
AND
NEARLY
TWICE
THE
USUAL
AMOUNT
OF
NECK
WHICH
CAME
IN
VERY
USEFUL
AS
SPENT
SO
MUCH
OF
HER
TIME
CRANING
OVER
GARDEN
FENCES
SPYING
ON
NEIGHBORS
THE
DURSLEYS
HAD
A
SMALL
SON
CALLED
DUDLEY
AND
IN
OPINION
THERE
WAS
NO
FINER
BOY
ANYWHERE
THE
DURSLEYS
HAD
EVERYTHING
THEY
WANTED
BUT
THEY
ALSO
HAD
A
SECRET
THEIR
GREATEST
FEAR
WAS
THAT
SOMEBODY
WOULD
DISCOVER
IT
THEY
THINK
THEY
COULD
BEAR
IT
IF
ANYONE
FOUND
OUT
ABOUT
THE
POTTERS
MRS
POTTER
WAS
MRS
DURSLEY'S
SISTER
BUT
THEY
HADN'T
MET
FOR
SEVERAL
YEARS
IN
FACT
MRS
DURSLEY
PRETENDED
SHE
DIDN'T
HAVE
A
SISTER
BECAUSE
SISTER
AND
HER
GOOD
FOR
NOTHING
HUSBAND
WERE
AS
UNDURSLEYISH
AS
IT
POSSIBLE
TO
BE
THE
DURSLEYS
SHUDDERED
TO
THINK
WHAT
THE
NEIGHBORS
SAY
IF
THE
POTTERS
ARRIVED
IN
THE
STREET
THE
DURSLEYS
KNEW
THAT
POTTERS
HAD
A
SMALL
SON
TOO
BUT
THEY
HAD
NEVER
EVEN
SEEN
HIM
THIS
WAS
ANOTHER
GOOD
REASON
FOR
KEEPING
THE
POTTERS
AWAY
THEY
DIDN'T
DUDLEY
MIXING
WITH
A
CHILD
LIKE
THAT
WHEN
MR
AND
MRS
DURSLEY
WOKE
UP
ON
THE
DULL
GRAY
TUESDAY
OUR
STARTS
THERE
WAS
NOTHING
ABOUT
THE
CLOUDY
SKY
OUTSIDE
TO
SUGGEST
STRANGE
AND
MYSTERIOUS
THINGS
WOULD
SOON
BE
HAPPENING
ALL
OVER
COUNTRY
MR
DURSLEY
HUMMED
AS
HE
PICKED
OUT
HIS
MOST
BORING
TIE
WORK
AND
MRS
DURSLEY
GOSSIPED
AWAY
HAPPILY
AS
SHE
WRESTLED
A
DUDLEY
INTO
HIS
HIGH
CHAIR
NONE
OF
THEM
NOTICED
A
LARGE
TAWNY
OWL
FLUTTER
PAST
THE
WINDOW
AT
HALF
PAST
EIGHT
MR
DURSLEY
PICKED
UP
HIS
BRIEFCASE
PECKED
MRS
DURSLEY
ON
THE
CHEEK
AND
TRIED
TO
KISS
DUDLEY
GOOD
BYE
BUT
MISSED
BECAUSE
DUDLEY
WAS
NOW
HAVING
A
TANTRUM
AND
THROWING
HIS
CEREAL
AT
WALLS
"LITTLE
TYKE
"
CHORTLED
MR
DURSLEY
AS
HE
LEFT
THE
HOUSE
HE
INTO
HIS
CAR
AND
BACKED
OUT
OF
NUMBER
FOUR'S
DRIVE
IT
WAS
ON
THE
CORNER
OF
THE
STREET
THAT
HE
NOTICED
THE
FIRST
SIGN
SOMETHING
PECULIAR
A
CAT
READING
A
MAP
FOR
A
SECOND
MR
DIDN'T
REALIZE
WHAT
HE
HAD
SEEN
THEN
HE
JERKED
HIS
HEAD
AROUND
LOOK
AGAIN
THERE
WAS
A
TABBY
CAT
STANDING
ON
THE
CORNER
OF
DRIVE
BUT
THERE
WASN'T
A
MAP
IN
SIGHT
WHAT
COULD
HE
HAVE
BEEN
OF
IT
MUST
HAVE
BEEN
A
TRICK
OF
THE
LIGHT
MR
DURSLEY
BLINKED
STARED
AT
THE
CAT
IT
STARED
BACK
AS
MR
DURSLEY
DROVE
AROUND
CORNER
AND
UP
THE
ROAD
HE
WATCHED
THE
CAT
IN
HIS
MIRROR
IT
WAS
READING
THE
SIGN
THAT
SAID
PRIVET
DRIVE
NO
LOOKING
AT
THE
SIGN
COULDN'T
READ
MAPS
OR
SIGNS
MR
DURSLEY
GAVE
HIMSELF
A
LITTLE
SHAKE
PUT
THE
CAT
OUT
OF
HIS
MIND
AS
HE
DROVE
TOWARD
TOWN
HE
THOUGHT
NOTHING
EXCEPT
A
LARGE
ORDER
OF
DRILLS
HE
WAS
HOPING
TO
GET
THAT
DAY
BUT
ON
THE
EDGE
OF
TOWN
DRILLS
WERE
DRIVEN
OUT
OF
HIS
MIND
BY
ELSE
AS
HE
SAT
IN
THE
USUAL
MORNING
TRAFFIC
JAM
HE
COULDN'T
NOTICING
THAT
THERE
SEEMED
TO
BE
A
LOT
OF
STRANGELY
DRESSED
ABOUT
PEOPLE
IN
CLOAKS
MR
DURSLEY
COULDN'T
BEAR
PEOPLE
WHO
DRESSED
FUNNY
CLOTHES
THE
GETUPS
YOU
SAW
ON
YOUNG
PEOPLE
HE
SUPPOSED
WAS
SOME
STUPID
NEW
FASHION
HE
DRUMMED
HIS
FINGERS
ON
THE
WHEEL
AND
HIS
EYES
FELL
ON
A
HUDDLE
OF
THESE
WEIRDOS
STANDING
CLOSE
BY
THEY
WERE
WHISPERING
EXCITEDLY
TOGETHER
MR
DURSLEY
ENRAGED
TO
SEE
THAT
A
COUPLE
OF
THEM
WEREN'T
YOUNG
AT
ALL
WHY
THAT
HAD
TO
BE
OLDER
THAN
HE
WAS
AND
WEARING
AN
EMERALD
GREEN
CLOAK
NERVE
OF
HIM
BUT
THEN
IT
STRUCK
MR
DURSLEY
THAT
THIS
WAS
PROBABLY
SILLY
STUNT
THESE
PEOPLE
WERE
OBVIOUSLY
COLLECTING
FOR
SOMETHING
YES
THAT
WOULD
BE
IT
THE
TRAFFIC
MOVED
ON
AND
A
FEW
MINUTES
LATER
MR
DURSLEY
ARRIVED
IN
THE
GRUNNINGS
PARKING
LOT
HIS
MIND
BACK
ON
DRILLS
MR
DURSLEY
ALWAYS
SAT
WITH
HIS
BACK
TO
THE
WINDOW
IN
HIS
OFFICE
ON
NINTH
FLOOR
IF
HE
HADN'T
HE
MIGHT
HAVE
FOUND
IT
HARDER
TO
ON
DRILLS
THAT
MORNING
HE
DIDN'T
SEE
THE
OWLS
SWOOP
ING
PAST
IN
DAYLIGHT
THOUGH
PEOPLE
DOWN
IN
THE
STREET
DID
THEY
POINTED
AND
OPEN
MOUTHED
AS
OWL
AFTER
OWL
SPED
OVERHEAD
MOST
OF
THEM
HAD
SEEN
AN
OWL
EVEN
AT
NIGHTTIME
MR
DURSLEY
HOWEVER
HAD
A
NORMAL

FREE
MORNING
HE
YELLED
AT
FIVE
DIFFERENT
PEOPLE
HE
SEVERAL
IMPORTANT
TELEPHONE
CALLS
AND
SHOUTED
A
BIT
MORE
HE
WAS
IN
VERY
GOOD
MOOD
UNTIL
LUNCHTIME
WHEN
HE
THOUGHT
HE'D
STRETCH
HIS
AND
WALK
ACROSS
THE
ROAD
TO
BUY
HIMSELF
A
BUN
FROM
THE
BAKERY
HE'D
FORGOTTEN
ALL
ABOUT
THE
PEOPLE
IN
CLOAKS
UNTIL
HE
PASSED
A
GROUP
THEM
NEXT
TO
THE
BAKER'S
HE
EYED
THEM
ANGRILY
AS
HE
PASSED
HE
KNOW
WHY
BUT
THEY
MADE
HIM
UNEASY
THIS
BUNCH
WERE
EXCITEDLY
TOO
AND
HE
COULDN'T
SEE
A
SINGLE
COLLECTING
TIN
IT
WAS
HIS
WAY
BACK
PAST
THEM
CLUTCHING
A
LARGE
DOUGHNUT
IN
A
BAG
THAT
CAUGHT
A
FEW
WORDS
OF
WHAT
THEY
WERE
SAYING
"THE
POTTERS
THAT'S
RIGHT
THAT'S
WHAT
I
HEARD
YES
THEIR
SON
MR
DURSLEY
STOPPED
DEAD
FEAR
FLOODED
HIM
HE
LOOKED
BACK
AT
WHISPERERS
AS
IF
HE
WANTED
TO
SAY
SOMETHING
TO
THEM
BUT
THOUGHT
OF
IT
HE
DASHED
BACK
ACROSS
THE
ROAD
HURRIED
UP
TO
HIS
OFFICE
SNAPPED
AT
SECRETARY
NOT
TO
DISTURB
HIM
SEIZED
HIS
TELEPHONE
AND
HAD
FINISHED
DIALING
HIS
HOME
NUMBER
WHEN
HE
CHANGED
HIS
MIND
HE
PUT
RECEIVER
BACK
DOWN
AND
STROKED
HIS
MUSTACHE
THINKING
NO
HE
BEING
STUPID
POTTER
WASN'T
SUCH
AN
UNUSUAL
NAME
HE
WAS
SURE
THERE
LOTS
OF
PEOPLE
CALLED
POTTER
WHO
HAD
A
SON
CALLED
HARRY
COME
TO
OF
IT
HE
WASN'T
EVEN
SURE
HIS
NEPHEW
WAS
CALLED
HARRY
HE'D
NEVER
SEEN
THE
BOY
IT
MIGHT
HAVE
BEEN
HARVEY
OR
HAROLD
THERE
WAS
NO
IN
WORRYING
MRS
DURSLEY
SHE
ALWAYS
GOT
SO
UPSET
AT
ANY
MENTION
OF
SISTER
HE
DIDN'T
BLAME
HER
IF
HE'D
HAD
A
SISTER
LIKE
THAT
BUT
THE
SAME
THOSE
PEOPLE
IN
CLOAKS
HE
FOUND
IT
A
LOT
HARDER
TO
CONCENTRATE
ON
DRILLS
THAT
AFTERNOON
WHEN
HE
LEFT
THE
BUILDING
AT
FIVE
O'CLOCK
HE
WAS
STILL
SO
WORRIED
HE
WALKED
STRAIGHT
INTO
SOMEONE
JUST
OUTSIDE
THE
DOOR
"SORRY
"
HE
GRUNTED
AS
THE
TINY
OLD
MAN
STUMBLED
AND
ALMOST
FELL
WAS
A
FEW
SECONDS
BEFORE
MR
DURSLEY
REALIZED
THAT
THE
MAN
WAS
WEARING
VIOLET
CLOAK
HE
DIDN'T
SEEM
AT
ALL
UPSET
AT
BEING
ALMOST
KNOCKED
TO
GROUND
ON
THE
CONTRARY
HIS
FACE
SPLIT
INTO
A
WIDE
SMILE
AND
HE
SAID
A
SQUEAKY
VOICE
THAT
MADE
PASSERSBY
STARE
"DON'T
BE

WAS
IMAGINING
THINGS
WHICH
HE
HAD
NEVER
HOPED
BEFORE
BECAUSE
DIDN'T
APPROVE
OF
IMAGINATION

HE
PULLED
INTO
THE
DRIVEWAY
OF
NUMBER
FOUR
THE
FIRST
THING
HE
SAW
AND
IT
DIDN'T
IMPROVE
HIS
MOOD
WAS

UNDER

AFTER

A

OFF
ONE
OF
THEM
PUT

ON
HARRY
WAS
USED

BECAUSE
THE
CUPBOARD
UNDER
THE

WAS

OF

WAS
WHERE
HE
SLEPT
WHEN
HE
WAS
DRESSED
HE
WENT
DOWN
THE

INTO
THE
KITCHEN
THE
WAS
ALMOST
HIDDEN
BENEATH

THOUGH
DUDLEY
HAD
GOTTEN
THE
NEW
COMPUTER
HE
WANTED
NOT
TO
MENTION
SECOND
TELEVISION
AND
THE
RACING
BIKE
EXACTLY
WHY
DUDLEY
WANTED
RACING
BIKE
WAS
A
MYSTERY
TO
HARRY

DUDLEY
WAS
VERY
FAT
AND
EXERCISE
UNLESS
OF

IT
INVOLVED
PUNCHING
SOMEBODY
FAVORITE
PUNCHING
BAG
WAS
HARRY
BUT
HE
COULDN'T
OFTEN
CATCH
HIM
DIDN'T
LOOK
IT

HE
WAS
VERY
FAST
PERHAPS
IT
HAD
SOMETHING
TO
DO
WITH
LIVING
IN
A
DARK
CUPBOARD
BUT
HAD
ALWAYS
BEEN
SMALL
AND
SKINNY
FOR
HIS
AGE
HE
LOOKED
EVEN
SMALLER
SKINNIER
THAN
HE
REALLY
WAS
BECAUSE
ALL
HE
HAD
TO
WEAR
WERE
OLD
OF
DUDLEY'S
AND
DUDLEY
WAS
ABOUT
FOUR
TIMES
BIGGER
THAN
HE
WAS

KNEES
BLACK
HAIR
AND
BRIGHT
GREEN
EYES
WORE
ROUND

HELD
TOGETHER
WITH
A

OF

BECAUSE
ALL
THE
TIMES
DUDLEY
HAD
PUNCHED
HIM
ON
THE
NOSE
THE
ONLY
THING
LIKED
ABOUT
HIS
OWN
APPEARANCE
WAS
A
VERY
THIN
SCAR
ON
HIS
FOREHEAD
WAS
SHAPED
LIKE
A
BOLT
OF

HE
HAD
HAD
IT
AS
LONG
AS
HE
REMEMBER

THE
FIRST
QUESTION
HE
COULD
EVER
REMEMBER
ASKING
HIS
PETUNIA
WAS
HOW
HE
HAD
GOTTEN
IT
"IN
THE
CAR
CRASH
WHEN
YOUR

DIED
"
SHE
HAD
SAID
"AND
DON'T

HARRY
MUST
HAVE
HAD
MORE
THAN
THE
REST
OF
THE
BOYS
IN
HIS

TOGETHER
BUT
IT
MADE
NO

HIS
HAIR
SIMPLY
GREW
THAT
WAY
ALL
OVER
THE
PLACE
HARRY
WAS
FRYING
EGGS
BY
THE
TIME
DUDLEY
ARRIVED
IN
THE

DUDLEY
LOOKED
A

LIKE

HARRY
PUT
THE

JERKED

HARRY
PUT

HOPEFULLY
(HE'D
BE
ABLE
WATCH
WHAT
HE
WANTED
ON
TELEVISION
FOR
A
CHANGE
AND
MAYBE
EVEN
HAVE
A
ON
DUDLEY'S
COMPUTER)
AUNT
PETUNIA
LOOKED
AS
THOUGH
SHE'D
JUST
SWALLOWED
A
LEMON
"AND
COME
BACK
AND
FIND
THE
HOUSE
IN
RUINS
"
SHE
SNARLED
"I
WON'T
BLOW
UP

SAID
HARRY
BUT
THEY
WEREN'T
LISTENING
"I
SUPPOSE
WE
COULD
TAKE
HIM
TO
THE
ZOO
"
SAID
AUNT
PETUNIA
SLOWLY
"
AND
LEAVE
HIM
IN
THE
CAR
"THAT
CAR'S
NEW
HE'S
NOT
SITTING
IN
IT
ALONE
DUDLEY
BEGAN
TO
CRY
LOUDLY
IN
FACT
HE
WASN'T
REALLY
CRYING
IT
BEEN
YEARS
SINCE
HE'D
REALLY
CRIED
BUT
HE
KNEW
THAT
IF
HE
SCREWED
HIS
FACE
AND
WAILED
HIS
MOTHER
WOULD
GIVE
HIM
ANYTHING
HE
WANTED
"DINKY
DUDDYDUMS
DON'T

SHE
CRIED
FLINGING
HER
ARMS
AROUND
HIM
"I
DON'T
WANT
HIM
T
T
TO

DUDLEY
YELLED
BETWEEN
HUGE
PRETEND
SOBS
"HE
ALWAYS
SP
SPOILS
EVERYTHING

HE
SHOT
HARRY
A
GRIN
THROUGH
THE
GAP
IN
HIS
MOTHER'S
ARMS
JUST
THEN
THE
DOORBELL
RANG
"OH
GOOD
LORD
THEY'RE
HERE

SAID
PETUNIA
FRANTICALLY
AND
A
MOMENT
LATER
DUDLEY'S
BEST
FRIEND
POLKISS
WALKED
IN
WITH
HIS
MOTHER
PIERS
WAS
A
SCRAWNY
BOY
WITH
A
LIKE
A
RAT
HE
WAS
USUALLY
THE
ONE
WHO
HELD
PEOPLE'S
ARMS
BEHIND
BACKS
WHILE
DUDLEY
HIT
THEM
DUDLEY
STOPPED
PRETENDING
TO
CRY
AT
ONCE
HALF
AN
HOUR
LATER
HARRY
WHO
COULDN'T
BELIEVE
HIS
LUCK
WAS
SITTING
THE
BACK
OF
THE
DURSLEYS'
CAR
WITH
PIERS
AND
DUDLEY
ON
THE
WAY
TO
ZOO
FOR
THE
FIRST
TIME
IN
HIS
LIFE
HIS
AUNT
AND
UNCLE
HADN'T
BEEN
TO
THINK
OF
ANYTHING
ELSE
TO
DO
WITH
HIM
BUT
BEFORE
THEY'D
LEFT
VERNON
HAD
TAKEN
HARRY
ASIDE
"I'M
WARNING
YOU
"
HE
HAD
SAID
PUTTING
HIS
LARGE
PURPLE
FACE
RIGHT
CLOSE
TO
HARRY'S
"I'M
WARNING
YOU
NOW
BOY
ANY
FUNNY
BUSINESS
ANYTHING
AT
ALL
AND
YOU'LL
BE
IN
THAT
CUPBOARD
FROM
NOW
CHRISTMAS
"I'M
NOT
GOING
TO
DO

SAID
HARRY
"HONESTLY
BUT
UNCLE
VERNON
DIDN'T
BELIEVE
HIM
NO
ONE
EVER
DID
THE
PROBLEM
WAS
STRANGE
THINGS
OFTEN

AROUND
HARRY
AND
IT
JUST
NO
GOOD
TELLING
THE
DURSLEYS
HE
DIDN'T
MAKE
THEM
HAPPEN
ONCE
AUNT
PETUNIA
TIRED
OF
HARRY
COMING
BACK
FROM
THE
BARBERS
AS
THOUGH
HE
HADN'T
BEEN
AT
ALL
HAD
TAKEN
A
PAIR
OF
KITCHEN
AND
CUT
HIS
HAIR
SO
SHORT
HE
WAS
ALMOST
BALD
EXCEPT
FOR
HIS
BANGS
SHE
LEFT
"TO
HIDE
THAT
HORRIBLE
SCAR
"
DUDLEY
HAD
LAUGHED
HIMSELF
AT
HARRY
WHO
SPENT
A
SLEEPLESS
NIGHT
IMAGINING
SCHOOL
THE
NEXT
DAY
WHERE
HE
WAS
ALREADY
LAUGHED
AT
FOR
HIS
BAGGY
CLOTHES
AND
TAPED
GLASSES
NEXT
MORNING
HOWEVER
HE
HAD
GOTTEN
UP
TO
FIND
HIS
HAIR
EXACTLY
AS
HAD
BEEN
BEFORE
AUNT
PETUNIA
HAD
SHEARED
IT
OFF
HE
HAD
BEEN
GIVEN
A
IN
HIS
CUPBOARD
FOR
THIS
EVEN
THOUGH
HE
HAD
TRIED
TO
EXPLAIN
THAT
COULDN'T
EXPLAIN
HOW
IT
HAD
GROWN
BACK
SO
QUICKLY
ANOTHER
TIME
AUNT
PETUNIA
HAD
BEEN
TRYING
TO
FORCE
HIM
INTO
A
OLD
SWEATER
OF
DUDLEY'S
(BROWN
WITH
ORANGE
PUFF
BALLS)
THE
HARDER
TRIED
TO
PULL
IT
OVER
HIS
HEAD
THE
SMALLER
IT
SEEMED
TO
BECOME
FINALLY
IT
MIGHT
HAVE
FITTED
A
HAND
PUPPET
BUT
CERTAINLY
WOULDN'T
HARRY
AUNT
PETUNIA
HAD
DECIDED
IT
MUST
HAVE
SHRUNK
IN
THE
WASH
AND
HIS
GREAT
RELIEF
HARRY
WASN'T
PUNISHED
ON
THE
OTHER
HAND
HE'D
GOTTEN
INTO
TERRIBLE
TROUBLE
FOR
BEING
FOUND
THE
ROOF
OF
THE
SCHOOL
KITCHENS
DUDLEY'S
GANG
HAD
BEEN
CHASING
HIM
USUAL
WHEN
AS
MUCH
TO
HARRY'S
SURPRISE
AS
ANYONE
ELSE'S
THERE
HE
SITTING
ON
THE
CHIMNEY
THE
DURSLEYS
HAD
RECEIVED
A
VERY
ANGRY
FROM
HARRY'S
HEADMISTRESS
TELLING
THEM
HARRY
HAD
BEEN
CLIMBING
BUILDINGS
BUT
ALL
HE'D
TRIED
TO
DO
(AS
HE
SHOUTED
AT
UNCLE
THROUGH
THE
LOCKED
DOOR
OF
HIS
CUPBOARD)
WAS
JUMP
BEHIND
THE
BIG
CANS
OUTSIDE
THE
KITCHEN
DOORS
HARRY
SUPPOSED
THAT
THE
WIND
MUST
CAUGHT
HIM
IN
MID
JUMP
BUT
TODAY
NOTHING
WAS
GOING
TO
GO
WRONG
IT
WAS
EVEN
WORTH
BEING
DUDLEY
AND
PIERS
TO
BE
SPENDING
THE
DAY
SOMEWHERE
THAT
WASN'T
SCHOOL
HIS
CUPBOARD
OR
MRS
FIGG'S
CABBAGE
SMELLING
LIVING
ROOM
WHILE
HE
DROVE
UNCLE
VERNON
COMPLAINED
TO
AUNT
PETUNIA
HE
LIKED
COMPLAIN
ABOUT
THINGS
PEOPLE
AT
WORK
HARRY
THE
COUNCIL
HARRY
BANK
AND
HARRY
WERE
JUST
A
FEW
OF
HIS
FAVORITE
SUBJECTS
THIS
MORNING
IT
WAS
MOTORCYCLES
"
ROARING
ALONG
LIKE
MANIACS
THE
YOUNG
HOODLUMS
"
HE
SAID
AS
MOTORCYCLE
OVERTOOK
THEM
I
HAD
A
DREAM
ABOUT
A
MOTORCYCLE
"
SAID
HARRY
REMEMBERING
SUDDENLY
WAS
FLYING
UNCLE
VERNON
NEARLY
CRASHED
INTO
THE
CAR
IN
FRONT
HE
TURNED
AROUND
IN
HIS
SEAT
AND
YELLED
AT
HARRY
HIS
FACE
LIKE
A
GIGANTIC
WITH
A
MUSTACHE
"MOTORCYCLES
DON'T
FLY
DUDLEY
AND
PIERS
SNIGGERED
I
KNOW
THEY
DON'T
"
SAID
HARRY
"IT
WAS
ONLY
A
DREAM
BUT
HE
WISHED
HE
HADN'T
SAID
ANYTHING
IF
THERE
WAS
ONE
THING
DURSLEYS
HATED
EVEN
MORE
THAN
HIS
ASKING
QUESTIONS
IT
WAS
HIS
ABOUT
ANYTHING
ACTING
IN
A
WAY
IT
SHOULDN'T
NO
MATTER
IF
IT
WAS
IN
DREAM
OR
EVEN
A
CARTOON
THEY
SEEMED
TO
THINK
HE
MIGHT
GET
IDEAS
IT
WAS
A
VERY
SUNNY
SATURDAY
AND
THE
ZOO
WAS
CROWDED
WITH
FAMILIES
DURSLEYS
BOUGHT
DUDLEY
AND
PIERS
LARGE
CHOCOLATE
ICE
CREAMS
AT
ENTRANCE
AND
THEN
BECAUSE
THE
SMILING
LADY
IN
THE
VAN
HAD
ASKED
WHAT
HE
WANTED
BEFORE
THEY
COULD
HURRY
HIM
AWAY
THEY
BOUGHT
HIM
A
LEMON
ICE
POP
IT
WASN'T
BAD
EITHER
HARRY
THOUGHT
LICKING
IT
AS
WATCHED
A
GORILLA
SCRATCHING
ITS
HEAD
WHO
LOOKED
REMARKABLY
LIKE
DUDLEY
EXCEPT
THAT
IT
WASN'T
BLOND
HARRY
HAD
THE
BEST
MORNING
HE'D
HAD
IN
A
LONG
TIME
HE
WAS
CAREFUL
WALK
A
LITTLE
WAY
APART
FROM
THE
DURSLEYS
SO
THAT
DUDLEY
AND
PIERS
WERE
STARTING
TO
GET
BORED
WITH
THE
ANIMALS
BY
LUNCHTIME
WOULDN'T
BACK
ON
THEIR
FAVORITE
HOBBY
OF
HITTING
HIM
THEY
ATE
IN
THE
RESTAURANT
AND
WHEN
DUDLEY
HAD
A
TANTRUM
BECAUSE
HIS
GLORY
DIDN'T
HAVE
ENOUGH
ICE
CREAM
ON
TOP
UNCLE
VERNON
BOUGHT
ANOTHER
ONE
AND
HARRY
WAS
ALLOWED
TO
FINISH
THE
FIRST
HARRY
FELT
AFTERWARD
THAT
HE
SHOULD
HAVE
KNOWN
IT
WAS
ALL
TOO
GOOD
LAST
AFTER
LUNCH
THEY
WENT
TO
THE
REPTILE
HOUSE
IT
WAS
COOL
AND
DARK
THERE
WITH
LIT
WINDOWS
ALL
ALONG
THE
WALLS
BEHIND
THE
GLASS
ALL
OF
LIZARDS
AND
SNAKES
WERE
CRAWLING
AND
SLITHERING
OVER
BITS
OF
WOOD
STONE
DUDLEY
AND
PIERS
WANTED
TO
SEE
HUGE
POISONOUS
COBRAS
AND
THICK
MAN
CRUSHING
PYTHONS
DUDLEY
QUICKLY
FOUND
THE
LARGEST
SNAKE
IN
PLACE
IT
COULD
HAVE
WRAPPED
ITS
BODY
TWICE
AROUND
UNCLE
VERNON'S
AND
CRUSHED
IT
INTO
A
TRASH
CAN
BUT
AT
THE
MOMENT
IT
DIDN'T
LOOK
THE
MOOD
IN
FACT
IT
WAS
FAST
ASLEEP
DUDLEY
STOOD
WITH
HIS
NOSE
PRESSED
AGAINST
THE
GLASS
STARING
AT
GLISTENING
BROWN
COILS
"MAKE
IT
MOVE
"
HE
WHINED
AT
HIS
FATHER
UNCLE
VERNON
TAPPED
ON
GLASS
BUT
THE
SNAKE
DIDN'T
BUDGE
"DO
IT
AGAIN
"
DUDLEY
ORDERED
UNCLE
VERNON
RAPPED
THE
GLASS
WITH
HIS
KNUCKLES
BUT
THE
SNAKE
JUST
SNOOZED
ON
"THIS
IS
BORING
"
DUDLEY
MOANED
HE
SHUFFLED
AWAY
HARRY
MOVED
IN
FRONT
OF
THE
TANK
AND
LOOKED
INTENTLY
AT
THE
SNAKE
WOULDN'T
HAVE
BEEN
SURPRISED
IF
IT
HAD
DIED
OF
BOREDOM
ITSELF
COMPANY
EXCEPT
STUPID
PEOPLE
DRUMMING
THEIR
FINGERS
ON
THE
GLASS
TO
DISTURB
IT
ALL
DAY
LONG
IT
WAS
WORSE
THAN
HAVING
A
CUPBOARD
AS
BEDROOM
WHERE
THE
ONLY
VISITOR
WAS
AUNT
PETUNIA
HAMMERING
ON
THE
TO
WAKE
YOU
UP
AT
LEAST
HE
GOT
TO
VISIT
THE
REST
OF
THE
HOUSE
THE
SNAKE
SUDDENLY
OPENED
ITS
BEADY
EYES
SLOWLY
VERY
SLOWLY
IT
ITS
HEAD
UNTIL
ITS
EYES
WERE
ON
A
LEVEL
WITH
HARRY'S
IT
WINKED
HARRY
STARED
THEN
HE
LOOKED
QUICKLY
AROUND
TO
SEE
IF
ANYONE
WATCHING
THEY
WEREN'T
HE
LOOKED
BACK
AT
THE
SNAKE
AND
WINKED
TOO
THE
SNAKE
JERKED
ITS
HEAD
TOWARD
UNCLE
VERNON
AND
DUDLEY
THEN
ITS
EYES
TO
THE
CEILING
IT
GAVE
HARRY
A
LOOK
THAT
SAID
QUITE
PLAINLY
"I
GET
THAT
ALL
THE
TIME
"I
KNOW
"
HARRY
MURMURED
THROUGH
THE
GLASS
THOUGH
HE
WASN'T
SURE
SNAKE
COULD
HEAR
HIM
"IT
MUST
BE
REALLY
ANNOYING
THE
SNAKE
NODDED
VIGOROUSLY
"WHERE
DO
YOU
COME
FROM
ANYWAY
"
HARRY
ASKED
THE
SNAKE
JABBED
ITS
TAIL
AT
A
LITTLE
SIGN
NEXT
TO
THE
GLASS
PEERED
AT
IT
BOA
CONSTRICTOR
BRAZIL
"WAS
IT
NICE
THERE
THE
BOA
CONSTRICTOR
JABBED
ITS
TAIL
AT
THE
SIGN
AGAIN
AND
HARRY
READ
ON
THIS
SPECIMEN
WAS
BRED
IN
THE
ZOO
"OH
I
SEE
SO
YOU'VE
NEVER
BEEN
BRAZIL
AS
THE
SNAKE
SHOOK
ITS
HEAD
A
DEAFENING
SHOUT
BEHIND
HARRY
MADE
BOTH
THEM
JUMP
"DUDLEY
MR
DURSLEY
COME
AND
LOOK
AT
THIS
SNAKE
YOU
WON'T
WHAT
IT'S
DOING
DUDLEY
CAME
WADDLING
TOWARD
THEM
AS
FAST
AS
HE
COULD
"OUT
OF
THE
WAY

"
HE
SAID
PUNCHING
HARRY
IN
THE
RIBS
CAUGHT
SURPRISE
HARRY
FELL
HARD
ON
THE
CONCRETE
FLOOR
WHAT
CAME
NEXT
SO
FAST
NO
ONE
SAW
HOW
IT
HAPPENED
ONE
SECOND
PIERS
AND
DUDLEY
LEANING
RIGHT
UP
CLOSE
TO
THE
GLASS
THE
NEXT
THEY
HAD
LEAPT
BACK
HOWLS
OF
HORROR
HARRY
SAT
UP
AND
GASPED
THE
GLASS
FRONT
OF
THE
BOA
CONSTRICTOR'S
HAD
VANISHED
THE
GREAT
SNAKE
WAS
UNCOILING
ITSELF
RAPIDLY
OUT
ONTO
THE
FLOOR
PEOPLE
THROUGHOUT
THE
REPTILE
HOUSE
SCREAMED
STARTED
RUNNING
FOR
THE
EXITS
AS
THE
SNAKE
SLID
SWIFTLY
PAST
HIM
HARRY
COULD
HAVE
SWORN
A
LOW
HISSING
VOICE
SAID
"BRAZIL
HERE
I
COME
THANKSSS
AMIGO
THE
KEEPER
OF
THE
REPTILE
HOUSE
WAS
IN
SHOCK
"BUT
THE
GLASS
"
HE
KEPT
SAYING
"WHERE
DID
THE
GLASS
GO
THE
ZOO
DIRECTOR
HIMSELF
MADE
AUNT
PETUNIA
A
CUP
OF
STRONG
SWEET
WHILE
HE
APOLOGIZED
OVER
AND
OVER
AGAIN
PIERS
AND
DUDLEY
COULD
GIBBER
AS
FAR
AS
HARRY
HAD
SEEN
THE
SNAKE
HADN'T
DONE

PLAYFULLY
AT
THEIR

AS
IT
PASSED
BUT
BY
THE
TIME
THEY
ALL
BACK
IN
UNCLE
VERNON'S
CAR
DUDLEY
WAS
TELLING
THEM
HOW
IT
NEARLY
BITTEN
OFF
HIS
LEG
WHILE
PIERS
WAS
SWEARING
IT
HAD
TRIED
SQUEEZE
HIM
TO
DEATH
BUT
WORST
OF
ALL
FOR
HARRY
AT
LEAST
WAS
CALMING
DOWN
ENOUGH
TO
SAY
"HARRY
WAS
TALKING
TO
IT
WEREN'T
YOU
HARRY
UNCLE
VERNON
WAITED
UNTIL
PIERS
WAS
SAFELY
OUT
OF

STARTING
ON
HARRY
HE
WAS
SO
ANGRY
HE
COULD
HARDLY
SPEAK
HE
MANAGED
SAY
"GO
CUPBOARD
STAY
NO
MEALS
"
BEFORE
HE
COLLAPSED
INTO
CHAIR
AND
AUNT
PETUNIA
HAD
TO
RUN
AND
GET
HIM
A
LARGE
BRANDY
HARRY
LAY
IN
HIS
DARK
CUPBOARD
MUCH
LATER
WISHING
HE
HAD
A
WATCH
DIDN'T
KNOW
WHAT
TIME
IT
WAS
AND
HE
COULDN'T
BE
SURE
THE
DURSLEYS
ASLEEP
YET
UNTIL
THEY
WERE
HE
COULDN'T
RISK
SNEAKING
TO
THE
FOR
SOME
FOOD
HE'D
LIVED
WITH
THE
DURSLEYS
ALMOST
TEN
YEARS
TEN
MISERABLE
YEARS
LONG
AS
HE
COULD
REMEMBER
EVER
SINCE
HE'D
BEEN
A
BABY
AND
HIS
HAD
DIED
IN
THAT
CAR
CRASH
HE
COULDN'T
REMEMBER
BEING
IN
THE
CAR
HIS
PARENTS
HAD
DIED
SOMETIMES
WHEN
HE
STRAINED
HIS
MEMORY
DURING
HOURS
IN
HIS
CUPBOARD
HE
CAME
UP
WITH
A
STRANGE
VISION
A
FLASH
OF
GREEN
LIGHT
AND
A
BURN
ING
PAIN
ON
HIS
FOREHEAD
THIS
SUPPOSED
WAS
THE
CRASH
THOUGH
HE
COULDN'T
IMAGINE
WHERE
ALL
THE
LIGHT
CAME
FROM
HE
COULDN'T
REMEMBER
HIS
PARENTS
AT
ALL
HIS
AUNT
UNCLE
NEVER
SPOKE
ABOUT
THEM
AND
OF
COURSE
HE
WAS
FORBIDDEN
TO
QUESTIONS
THERE
WERE
NO
PHOTOGRAPHS
OF
THEM
IN
THE
HOUSE
WHEN
HE
HAD
BEEN
YOUNGER
HARRY
HAD
DREAMED
AND
DREAMED
OF
SOME
RELATION
COMING
TO
TAKE
HIM
AWAY
BUT
IT
HAD
NEVER
HAPPENED
DURSLEYS
WERE
HIS
ONLY
FAMILY
YET
SOMETIMES
HE
THOUGHT
(OR
MAYBE
THAT
STRANGERS
IN
THE
STREET
SEEMED
TO
KNOW
HIM
VERY
STRANGE
THEY
WERE
TOO
A
TINY
MAN
IN
A
VIOLET
TOP
HAT
HAD
BOWED
TO
HIM
WHILE
OUT
SHOPPING
WITH
AUNT
PETUNIA
AND
DUDLEY
AFTER
ASKING
FURIOUSLY
IF
HE
KNEW
THE
MAN
AUNT
PETUNIA
HAD
RUSHED
THEM
OUT
OF
SHOP
WITHOUT
BUYING
ANYTHING
A
WILD
LOOKING
OLD
WOMAN
DRESSED
ALL
GREEN
HAD
WAVED
MERRILY
AT
HIM
ONCE
ON
A
BUS
A
BALD
MAN
IN
A
VERY
PURPLE
COAT
HAD
ACTUALLY
SHAKEN
HIS
HAND
IN
THE
STREET
THE
OTHER
DAY
THEN
WALKED
AWAY
WITHOUT
A
WORD
THE
WEIRDEST
THING
ABOUT
ALL
PEOPLE
WAS
THE
WAY
THEY
SEEMED
TO
VANISH
THE
SECOND
HARRY
TRIED
TO
GET
CLOSER
LOOK
AT
SCHOOL
HARRY
HAD
NO
ONE
EVERYBODY
KNEW
THAT
DUDLEY'S
GANG
THAT
ODD
HARRY
POTTER
IN
HIS
BAGGY
OLD
CLOTHES
AND
BROKEN
GLASSES
NOBODY
LIKED
TO
DISAGREE
WITH
DUDLEY'S
GANG
CHAPTER
THE
LETTERS
FROM
NO
THE
ESCAPE
OF
THE
BRAZILIAN
BOA
CONSTRICTOR
EARNED
HARRY
LONGEST
EVER
PUNISHMENT
BY
THE
TIME
HE
WAS
ALLOWED
OUT
OF
HIS
AGAIN
THE
SUMMER
HOLIDAYS
HAD
STARTED
AND
DUDLEY
HAD
ALREADY
BROKEN
NEW
VIDEO
CAMERA
CRASHED
HIS
REMOTE
CONTROL
AIRPLANE
AND
FIRST
OUT
ON
HIS
RACING
BIKE
KNOCKED
DOWN
OLD
MRS
FIGG
AS
SHE
CROSSED
DRIVE
ON
HER
CRUTCHES
HARRY
WAS
GLAD
SCHOOL
WAS
OVER
BUT
THERE
WAS
NO
ESCAPING
DUDLEY'S
GANG
WHO
VISITED
THE
HOUSE
EVERY
SINGLE
DAY
PIERS
DENNIS
MALCOLM
GORDON
WERE
ALL
BIG
AND
STUPID
BUT
AS
DUDLEY
WAS
THE
BIGGEST
STUPIDEST
OF
THE
LOT
HE
WAS
THE
LEADER
THE
REST
OF
THEM
WERE
ALL
HAPPY
TO
JOIN
IN
DUDLEY'S
FAVORITE
SPORT
HARRY
HUNTING
THIS
WAS
WHY
HARRY
SPENT
AS
MUCH
TIME
AS
POSSIBLE
OUT
OF
THE
HOUSE
WANDERING
AROUND
AND
THINKING
ABOUT
THE
END
OF
THE
HOLIDAYS
WHERE
COULD
SEE
A
TINY
RAY
OF
HOPE
WHEN
SEPTEMBER
CAME
HE
WOULD
BE
GOING
TO
SECONDARY
SCHOOL
AND
FOR
THE
FIRST
TIME
IN
HIS
LIFE
HE
WOULDN'T
WITH
DUDLEY

BEEN
ACCEPTED
AT

WAS
GOING
THERE
TOO
HARRY
ON

WAS
GOING
TO
STONEWALL
HIGH
THE
LOCAL
PUBLIC
SCHOOL
THOUGHT
THIS
WAS
VERY
FUNNY
"THEY
STUFF
PEOPLE'S
HEADS
DOWN
THE
TOILET
THE
FIRST
DAY
AT
STONEWALL
HE
TOLD
HARRY
"WANT
TO
COME

OF

SHE
LET
HARRY

GAVE
HIM
A
BIT
OF
CHOCOLATE

THAT
TASTED
AS
SHE'D

UNCLE

GRUFFLY
THAT
IT
WAS
THE
PROUDEST
MOMENT
OF

ICKLE
DUDLEYKINS
LOOKED
SO
HANDSOME
AND
GROWN
UP

TRUST
HIMSELF
TO
SPEAK
THOUGHT
TWO
OF
HIS

MIGHT
ALREADY
HAVE
CRACKED
FROM
TRYING
NOT
LAUGH
THERE
WAS
A
HORRIBLE
SMELL
IN
THE
KITCHEN
THE
NEXT
MORNING
WHEN
WENT
IN
FOR
BREAKFAST
IT
SEEMED
TO
BE
COMING
FROM
A
LARGE
METAL

THE

HE
WENT
TO
HAVE
A
LOOK
THE
TUB
WAS
FULL
OF
WHAT
LOOKED
DIRTY
RAGS
SWIMMING
IN
GRAY
WATER
"WHAT'S
THIS
"
HE
ASKED
AUNT
PETUNIA
HER
LIPS
TIGHTENED
AS
THEY
DID
IF
HE
DARED
TO
ASK
A
QUESTION
"YOUR

SHE
SAID
HARRY
LOOKED
IN
THE

HARRY
SERIOUSLY
DOUBTED
THIS
BUT
THOUGHT
IT
BEST
NOT
TO
ARGUE
HE
DOWN
AT
THE

AND
TRIED
NOT
TO
THINK
ABOUT
HOW
HE
WAS
GOING
TO
ON
HIS
FIRST
DAY
AT
STONEWALL
HIGH
LIKE
HE
WAS
WEARING
BITS
OF
ELEPHANT

PROBABLY
DUDLEY
AND
UNCLE

CAME
IN
BOTH
WITH
WRINKLED
NOSES
BECAUSE
OF
SMELL
FROM
HARRY'S

UNCLE
VERNON
OPENED
HIS
NEWSPAPER
USUAL

DUDLEY
BANGED
HIS
SMELTING

HE
CARRIED
EVERYWHERE
ON
THE

THEY
HEARD
THE

OF
THE

WHOLE
LIFE
HAD
WRITTEN
TO
HIM
WOULD
HE
HAD
NO
FRIENDS
NO
OTHER

WENT
FROM

SAID
HAGRID
A
PAIR
OF
GOBLINS
BOWED
THEM
THROUGH
THE
SILVER
DOORS
AND
THEY
WERE
IN
VAST
MARBLE
HALL
ABOUT
A
HUNDRED
MORE
GOBLINS
WERE
SITTING
ON

BEHIND
A
LONG
COUNTER
SCRIBBLING
IN
LARGE
LEDGERS
COINS
IN
BRASS
SCALES
EXAMINING
PRECIOUS
STONES
THROUGH

THERE
WERE
TOO

GOBLINS
WERE
SHOWING
PEOPLE
IN
AND
OUT
OF
THESE
HAGRID
AND
HARRY
FOR

SAID
HAGRID
AND
HE
STARTED
EMPTYING
POCKETS
ONTO
THE
COUNTER
SCATTERING
A
HANDFUL
OF
MOLDY

OVER
THE
GOBLIN'S

SAID
HAGRID
AT

HOLDING
UP
A
TINY
GOLDEN
KEY
THE
GOBLIN
LOOKED
AT
IT
CLOSELY
"THAT
SEEMS
TO
BE
IN

"AN'
I'VE
ALSO
GOT
A

THE

"I

HE
AND

OF

ASKED
"CAN'T

SAID
HAGRID
MYSTERIOUSLY
"VERY
SECRET

DUMBLEDORE'S
TRUSTED
ME
MORE'N
MY

WORTH
TER

THAT
GRIPHOOK
HELD
THE

FOR

HARRY
WHO
HAD
EXPECTED
MARBLE
WAS
SURPRISED
THEY
WERE
IN
A
NARROW
STONE
PASSAGEWAY
LIT
FLAMING
TORCHES
IT
SLOPED
STEEPLY
DOWNWARD
AND
THERE
WERE
RAILWAY
TRACKS
ON
THE
FLOOR
GRIPHOOK
WHISTLED
AND
A
SMALL
CART
HURTLING
UP
THE
TRACKS
TOWARD
THEM
THEY
CLIMBED
IN
HAGRID
WITH
DIFFICULTY
AND
WERE
OFF
AT
FIRST
THEY
JUST
HURTLED
THROUGH
A
MAZE
OF
TWISTING
PASSAGES
TRIED
TO
REMEMBER
LEFT
RIGHT
RIGHT
LEFT
MIDDLE
FORK
RIGHT
LEFT
BUT
IT
WAS
IMPOSSIBLE
THE
RATTLING
CART
SEEMED
TO
KNOW
ITS
OWN
WAY
BECAUSE
GRIPHOOK
WASN'T
STEERING
HARRY'S
EYES
STUNG
AS
THE
COLD
AIR
RUSHED
PAST
THEM
BUT
HE
KEPT
WIDE
OPEN
ONCE
HE
THOUGHT
HE
SAW
A
BURST
OF
FIRE
AT
THE
END
OF
PASSAGE
AND
TWISTED
AROUND
TO
SEE
IF
IT
WAS
A
DRAGON
BUT
TOO
LATE
THEY
PLUNGED
EVEN
DEEPER
PASSING
AN
UNDERGROUND
LAKE
WHERE
STALACTITES
AND
STALAGMITES
GREW
FROM
THE
CEILING
AND
FLOOR
I
NEVER
KNOW
"
HARRY
CALLED
TO
HAGRID
OVER
THE
NOISE
OF
THE
CART
"WHAT'S
THE
DIFFERENCE
BETWEEN
A
STALAGMITE
AND
A
STALACTITE
"STALAGMITE'S
GOT
AN
'M'
IN
IT
"
SAID
HAGRID
"AN'
DON'
ASK
ME
JUST
NOW
I
THINK
I'M
GONNA
BE
SICK
HE
DID
LOOK
VERY
GREEN
AND
WHEN
THE
CART
STOPPED
AT
LAST
BESIDE
A
DOOR
IN
THE
PASSAGE
WALL
HAGRID
GOT
OUT
AND
HAD
TO
LEAN
AGAINST
WALL
TO
STOP
HIS
KNEES
FROM
TREMBLING
GRIPHOOK
UNLOCKED
THE
DOOR
A
LOT
OF
GREEN
SMOKE
CAME
BILLOWING
OUT
AS
IT
CLEARED
HARRY
GASPED
INSIDE
WERE
MOUNDS
OF
GOLD
COINS
OF
SILVER
HEAPS
OF
LITTLE
BRONZE
KNUTS
"ALL

SMILED
HAGRID
ALL
HARRY'S
IT
WAS
INCREDIBLE
THE
DURSLEYS
COULDN'T
HAVE
KNOWN
THIS
OR
THEY'D
HAVE
HAD
IT
FROM
HIM
FASTER
THAN
BLINKING
HOW
OFTEN
THEY
COMPLAINED
HOW
MUCH
HARRY
COST
THEM
TO
KEEP
AND
ALL
THE
TIME
HAD
BEEN
A
SMALL
FORTUNE
BELONGING
TO
HIM
BURIED
DEEP
UNDER
LONDON
HAGRID
HELPED
HARRY
PILE
SOME
OF
IT
INTO
A
BAG
"THE
GOLD
ONES

GALLEONS
"
HE
EXPLAINED
"SEVENTEEN

HE
TURNED
TO
GRIPHOOK
"VAULT
SEVEN
HUNDRED
AND
THIRTEEN
NOW
PLEASE
AND
CAN
WE
GO
MORE
SLOWLY
"ONE

SAID
GRIPHOOK
THEY
WERE
GOING
EVEN
DEEPER
NOW
AND
GATHERING
SPEED
THE
AIR
COLDER
AND
COLDER
AS
THEY
HURTLED
ROUND
TIGHT
CORNERS
THEY
RATTLING
OVER
AN
UNDERGROUND
RAVINE
AND
HARRY
LEANED
OVER
THE
SIDE
TRY
TO
SEE
WHAT
WAS
DOWN
AT
THE
DARK
BOTTOM
BUT
HAGRID
GROANED
PULLED
HIM
BACK
BY
THE
SCRUFF
OF
HIS
NECK
VAULT
SEVEN
HUNDRED
AND
THIRTEEN
HAD
NO
KEYHOLE
"STAND

SAID
GRIPHOOK
IMPORTANTLY
HE
STROKED
THE
DOOR
GENTLY
ONE
OF
HIS
LONG
FINGERS
AND
IT
SIMPLY
MELTED
AWAY
"IF
ANYONE
BUT
A
GRINGOTTS
GOBLIN
TRIED
THAT
THEY'D
BE
SUCKED
THE
DOOR
AND
TRAPPED
IN

"
SAID
GRIPHOOK
"HOW
OFTEN
DO
YOU
CHECK
TO
SEE
IF
ANYONE'S
INSIDE
"
HARRY
ASKED
"ABOUT
ONCE
EVERY
TEN
YEARS
"
SAID
GRIPHOOK
WITH
A
RATHER
NASTY
GRIN
SOMETHING
REALLY
EXTRAORDINARY
HAD
TO
BE
INSIDE
THIS
TOP
SECURITY
VAULT
HARRY
WAS
SURE
AND
HE
LEANED
FORWARD
EAGERLY
EXPECTING
TO
SEE
JEWELS
AT
THE
VERY
LEAST
BUT
AT
FIRST
HE
THOUGHT
IT
WAS
EMPTY
HE
NOTICED
A
GRUBBY
LITTLE
PACKAGE
WRAPPED
UP
IN
BROWN
PAPER
LYING
THE
FLOOR
HAGRID
PICKED
IT
UP
AND
TUCKED
IT
DEEP
INSIDE
HIS
COAT
LONGED
TO
KNOW
WHAT
IT
WAS
BUT
KNEW
BETTER
THAN
TO
ASK
"COME
ON
BACK
IN
THIS
INFERNAL
CART
AND
DON'T
TALK
TO
ME
ON
THE
BACK
IT'S
BEST
IF

SAID
HAGRID
ONE
WILD

RIDE
LATER
THEY
STOOD
BLINKING
IN
THE
SUNLIGHT
GRINGOTTS
HARRY
DIDN'T
KNOW
WHERE
TO
RUN
FIRST
NOW
THAT
HE
HAD
A
FULL
OF
MONEY
HE
DIDN'T
HAVE
TO
KNOW
HOW
MANY
GALLEONS
THERE
WERE
TO
POUND
TO
KNOW
THAT
HE
WAS
HOLDING
MORE
MONEY
THAN
HE'D
HAD
IN
HIS
LIFE
MORE
MONEY
THAN
EVEN
DUDLEY
HAD
EVER
HAD
"MIGHT

SAID
HAGRID
NODDING
TOWARD

HE
DID
STILL
LOOK
A
BIT
SICK
SO
HARRY
ENTERED
MALKIN'S

ALONE
FEELING
NERVOUS
MADAM

HARRY
WAS
STRONGLY
REMINDED
OF

THE

WENT
ON
"NO

SAID
HARRY
"PLAY

COULD
SAY
SOMETHING
A

MORE
INTERESTING
"I

SAID
THE

SUDDENLY
NODDING
TOWARD

HAGRID
WAS
STANDING
THERE
GRINNING
AT
HARRY
AND
AT
TWO
LARGE
ICE

WITH
A
SLIGHT
SNEER
"WHY

SAID
HARRY
SHORTLY
HE
DIDN'T
FEEL

"OH

SAID
THE

THERE
WERE

UNLESS
ASKED
POLITELY

TICKLED
THEM
IN
EXACTLY
THE
RIGHT
PLACE
AND
THAT
WEREN'T
REALLY
DOORS
AT

SOLID

JUST
PRETENDING
WAS
ALSO
VERY
HARD
TO

WHERE

ON

FIRST
MORNING
FILCH
FOUND

THAT
UNLUCKILY

OUT
TO

HE
WOULDN'T

SURE
THEY
WERE

OWNED
A

FILCH
KNEW
THE
SECRET
PASSAGEWAYS
OF
THE

BETTER
ANYONE
(EXCEPT
PERHAPS
THE
WEASLEY
TWINS)
AND
COULD
POP
UP
AS
AS
ANY
OF
THE
GHOSTS
THE
STUDENTS
ALL
HATED
HIM
AND
IT
WAS
THE
AMBITION
OF
MANY
TO
GIVE
MRS
NORRIS
A
GOOD
KICK
AND
THEN
ONCE
YOU
HAD
MANAGED
TO
FIND
THEM
THERE
WERE
THE
THEMSELVES
THERE
WAS
A
LOT
MORE
TO
MAGIC
AS
HARRY
QUICKLY
FOUND
OUT
THAN
WAVING
YOUR
WAND
AND
SAYING
A
FEW
FUNNY
WORDS
THEY
HAD
TO
STUDY
THE
NIGHT
SKIES
THROUGH
THEIR

WEDNESDAY
AT

AND
LEARN
THE

OF
DIFFERENT

AND
MOVEMENTS
OF

THREE
TIMES
A

THEY
WENT
OUT
TO
GREENHOUSES
BEHIND
THE

TO
STUDY
HERBOLOGY
WITH
A
DUMPY
WITCH
CALLED
PROFESSOR
SPROUT
WHERE
THEY
LEARNED
HOW
TO
TAKE
CARE
ALL
THE
STRANGE
PLANTS
AND
FUNGI
AND
FOUND
OUT
WHAT
THEY
WERE
USED
FOR
EASILY
THE
MOST
BORING
CLASS
WAS
HISTORY
OF
MAGIC
WHICH
WAS
THE
ONE
TAUGHT
BY
A
GHOST
PROFESSOR
BINNS
HAD
BEEN
VERY
INDEED
WHEN
HE
HAD
FALLEN

AND
UP
NEXT
MORNING
TO

LEAVING
HIS

OVER
HIS

AT
THE
START
OF

HE
TOOK
THE

AND
WHEN
HE
REACHED
HARRY'S

GAVE
AN
EXCITED
SQUEAK
AND
TOPPLED
OUT
OF
SIGHT
PROFESSOR
MCGONAGALL
WAS
AGAIN
DIFFERENT
HARRY
HAD
BEEN
QUITE
RIGHT
THINK
SHE
WASN'T
A
TEACHER
TO
CROSS
STRICT
AND
CLEVER
SHE
GAVE
THEM
TALKING
TO
THE
MOMENT
THEY
SAT
DOWN
IN
HER
FIRST
CLASS
"TRANSFIGURATION
IS
SOME
OF
THE
MOST
COMPLEX
AND
DANGEROUS
MAGIC

"
SHE
SAID
"ANYONE
MESSING
AROUND
IN
MY
WILL
LEAVE
AND
NOT
COME
BACK
YOU
HAVE
BEEN
WARNED
THEN
SHE
CHANGED
HER
DESK
INTO
A
PIG
AND
BACK
AGAIN
THEY
WERE
ALL
IMPRESSED
AND
COULDN'T
WAIT
TO
GET
STARTED
BUT
SOON
REALIZED
WEREN'T
GOING
TO
BE
CHANGING
THE
FURNITURE
INTO
ANIMALS
FOR
A
LONG
TIME
AFTER
TAKING
A
LOT
OF
COMPLICATED
NOTES
THEY
WERE
EACH
GIVEN
A
AND
STARTED
TRYING
TO
TURN
IT
INTO
A
NEEDLE
BY
THE
END
OF
THE
LESSON
ONLY
HERMIONE
GRANGER
HAD
MADE
ANY
DIFFERENCE
TO
HER
MATCH
MCGONAGALL
SHOWED
THE

HOW
IT
HAD
GONE
ALL
SILVER
AND
POINTY
GAVE
HERMIONE
A
RARE
SMILE
THE
CLASS
EVERYONE
HAD
REALLY
BEEN
LOOKING
FORWARD
TO

AGAINST
THE
DARK

BUT
QUIRRELL'S
LESSONS
TURNED
OUT
TO
BE
A
BIT
A
JOKE
HIS
CLASSROOM
SMELLED
STRONGLY
OF
GARLIC
WHICH
EVERYONE
WAS
TO
WARD
OFF
A
VAMPIRE
HE'D
MET
IN
ROMANIA
AND
WAS
AFRAID
WOULD
COMING

GIVEN
TO
HIM
BY
AN
AFRICAN
PRINCE
AS
A
THANK
YOU
FOR
GETTING

A
TROUBLESOME
ZOMBIE
BUT
THEY
WEREN'T
SURE
THEY
BELIEVED
THIS
STORY
FOR
ONE
THING
WHEN
SEAMUS
FINNIGAN
ASKED
EAGERLY
TO
HEAR
HOW
HAD
FOUGHT
OFF
THE
ZOMBIE
QUIRRELL
WENT
PINK
AND
STARTED
TALKING
THE
WEATHER
FOR
ANOTHER
THEY
HAD
NOTICED
THAT
A
FUNNY
SMELL
AROUND
THE
TURBAN
AND
THE
WEASLEY
TWINS
INSISTED
THAT
IT
WAS
FULL
OF
GARLIC
AS
WELL
SO
THAT
QUIRRELL
WAS
PROTECTED
WHEREVER
HE
WENT
HARRY
WAS
VERY
RELIEVED
TO
FIND
OUT
THAT
HE
WASN'T
MILES
BEHIND
ELSE
LOTS
OF
PEOPLE
HAD
COME
FROM
MUGGLE
FAMILIES
AND
LIKE
HIM
HAD
ANY
IDEA
THAT
THEY
WERE
WITCHES
AND
WIZARDS
THERE
WAS
SO
MUCH
LEARN
THAT
EVEN
PEOPLE
LIKE
RON
DIDN'T
HAVE
MUCH
OF
A

START
FRIDAY
WAS
AN
IMPORTANT
DAY
FOR
HARRY
AND
RON
THEY
FINALLY
MANAGED
FIND
THEIR
WAY
DOWN
TO
THE
GREAT

FOR
BREAKFAST
WITHOUT
GETTING

"WHAT

HARRY
ASKED
RON
AS

"DOUBLE

STOPPED
HER
FROM
GIVING

THE

THEN
THE

GOTTEN

GIVEN
HIM
A
BIT
OF
A
SHOCK
ON
THE
FIRST

WHEN
ABOUT

OWLS
HAD
SUDDENLY
STREAMED
INTO
THE
GREAT

DURING

CIRCLING

UNTIL
THEY

OUT
TO
BE
THE
WORST
THING
THAT

HIM
SO

AT
THE
START
OF

BANQUET
HARRY
HAD
GOTTEN
THE
IDEA
THAT

WEIGHED
DOWN

HAD
GIVEN
HIM
AS
TO
THINK
ABOUT

THAT
WAS
BEFORE
HE
MET
DRACO
MALFOY
	STILL
FIRST
GRYFFINDORS
ONLY
HAD
POTIONS
WITH
THE
SLYTHERINS
SO
THEY
DIDN'T
HAVE
PUT

MUCH
OR
AT

THEY
DIDN'T
UNTIL
THEY
SPOTTED

"YOU

SAID
REASONABLY
"ANYWAY
I
KNOW

BUT
I
BET
THAT'S
ALL

TALK
ABOUT

TRYING
TO

HAD
NEVER

HARRY
FELT
SHE'D
GOOD
REASON
BECAUSE
NEVILLE
MANAGED
TO
HAVE
AN
EXTRAORDINARY
NUMBER
ACCIDENTS

HARRY'S

FOR
THE
LAST
MINUTE
"WHAT
HARRY
TURNED
AROUND
AND
SAW
QUITE
CLEARLY
WHAT
FOR
A
MOMENT
WAS
SURE
HE'D
WALKED
INTO
A
NIGHTMARE
THIS
WAS
TOO
MUCH
ON
TOP
EVERYTHING
THAT
HAD
HAPPENED
SO
FAR
THEY
WEREN'T
IN
A
ROOM
AS
HE
HAD
SUPPOSED
THEY
WERE
IN
A
CORRIDOR
FORBIDDEN
CORRIDOR
ON
THE
THIRD
FLOOR
AND
NOW
THEY
KNEW
WHY
IT
FORBIDDEN
THEY
WERE
LOOKING
STRAIGHT
INTO
THE
EYES
OF
A
MONSTROUS
DOG
A
DOG
FILLED
THE
WHOLE
SPACE
BETWEEN
CEILING
AND
FLOOR
IT
HAD
THREE
HEADS
THREE
PAIRS
OF
ROLLING
MAD
EYES
THREE
NOSES
AND
QUIVERING
IN
THEIR
DIRECTION
THREE
DROOLING
MOUTHS
SALIVA
IN
SLIPPERY
ROPES
FROM
YELLOWISH
FANGS
IT
WAS
STANDING
QUITE
STILL
ALL
SIX
EYES
STARING
AT
THEM
AND
KNEW
THAT
THE
ONLY
REASON
THEY
WEREN'T
ALREADY
DEAD
WAS
THAT
SUDDEN
APPEARANCE
HAD
TAKEN
IT
BY
SURPRISE
BUT
IT
WAS
QUICKLY
OVER
THAT
THERE
WAS
NO
MISTAKING
WHAT
THOSE
THUNDEROUS
GROWLS
MEANT
HARRY
GROPED
FOR
THE
DOORKNOB
BETWEEN
FILCH
AND
DEATH
HE'D
FILCH
THEY
FELL
BACKWARD
HARRY
SLAMMED
THE
DOOR
SHUT
AND
THEY
RAN
ALMOST
FLEW
BACK
DOWN
THE
CORRIDOR
FILCH
MUST
HAVE
HURRIED
OFF
TO
FOR
THEM
SOMEWHERE
ELSE
BECAUSE
THEY
DIDN'T
SEE
HIM
ANYWHERE
BUT
HARDLY
CARED
ALL
THEY
WANTED
TO
DO
WAS
PUT
AS
MUCH
SPACE
AS
BETWEEN
THEM
AND
THAT
MONSTER
THEY
DIDN'T
STOP
RUNNING
UNTIL
REACHED
THE
PORTRAIT
OF
THE
FAT
LADY
ON
THE
SEVENTH
FLOOR
"WHERE

SHE
ASKED

TREMBLING
INTO

IT
WAS
A
WHILE

SAID

HE'D
NEVER

"WHAT

STOOD
UP

HOPE
YOU'RE
PLEASED

STARED
AFTER

HIS
MOUTH
OPEN
"NO
WE
DON'T

HE
SAID
"YOU'D
THINK
WE
DRAGGED
HER
ALONG
WOULDN'T
YOU

HERMIONE
HAD
GIVEN
HARRY
SOMETHING
ELSE
TO
THINK
ABOUT
AS
HE
BACK
INTO

THE

WAS
GUARDING

WHAT
HAD
HAGRID
SAID
GRINGOTTS
WAS
THE
SAFEST
PLACE
IN
THE

FOR
SOMETHING
YOU
WANTED
HIDE
EXCEPT
PERHAPS
HOGWARTS
IT
LOOKED
AS
THOUGH
HARRY
HAD
FOUND
OUT
WHERE
THE
GRUBBY
LITTIE
FROM
VAULT
SEVEN
HUNDRED
AND
THIRTEEN
WAS
CHAPTER
MALFOY
COULDN'T
BELIEVE
HIS
EYES
WHEN
HE
SAW
THAT
HARRY
AND
RON
STILL
AT
HOGWARTS
THE
NEXT
DAY
LOOKING
TIRED
BUT
PERFECTLY
CHEERFUL
INDEED
BY
THE
NEXT
MORNING
HARRY
AND
RON
THOUGHT
THAT
MEETING
THREE
HEADED
DOG
HAD
BEEN
AN
EXCELLENT
ADVENTURE
AND
THEY
WERE
KEEN
TO
HAVE
ANOTHER
ONE
IN
THE
MEANTIME
HARRY
FILLED
RON
IN
ABOUT
PACKAGE
THAT
SEEMED
TO
HAVE
BEEN
MOVED
FROM
GRINGOTTS
TO

THEY
SPENT
A
LOT
OF
TIME
WONDERING
WHAT
COULD
POSSIBLY
NEED
SUCH
PROTECTION
"IT'S
EITHER
REALLY
VALUABLE
OR
REALLY
DANGEROUS
"
SAID
RON
"OR
BOTH
"
SAID
HARRY
BUT
AS
ALL
THEY
KNEW
FOR
SURE
ABOUT
THE
MYSTERIOUS
OBJECT
WAS
THAT
WAS
ABOUT
TWO
INCHES
LONG
THEY
DIDN'T
HAVE
MUCH
CHANCE
OF
GUESSING
IT
WAS
WITHOUT
FURTHER
CLUES
NEITHER
NEVILLE
NOR
HERMIONE
SHOWED
THE
SLIGHTEST
INTEREST
IN
WHAT
UNDERNEATH
THE
DOG
AND
THE
TRAPDOOR
ALL
NEVILLE
CARED
ABOUT
WAS
GOING
NEAR
THE
DOG
AGAIN
HERMIONE
WAS
NOW
REFUSING
TO
SPEAK
TO
HARRY
AND
RON
BUT
SHE
WAS
SUCH
BOSSY
KNOW
IT
ALL
THAT
THEY
SAW
THIS
AS
AN
ADDED
BONUS
ALL
THEY
WANTED
NOW
WAS
A
WAY
OF
GETTING
BACK
AT
MALFOY
AND
TO
THEIR
DELIGHT
JUST
SUCH
A
THING
ARRIVED
IN
THE

ABOUT
A
WEEK
LATER

EVERYONE'S
WAS
CAUGHT
AT

BY
A
LONG
THIN

CARRIED
BY
SIX
LARGE
OWLS
HARRY
WAS
JUST
AS
INTERESTED
AS
EVERYONE
ELSE
TO
SEE
WHAT
WAS
THIS
LARGE
PARCEL
AND
WAS
AMAZED
WHEN
THE
OWLS
SOARED
DOWN
AND
IT
RIGHT
IN

OF
HIM
KNOCKING
HIS

THEY
HARDLY
FLUTTERED
OUT

WHEN
ANOTHER

DROPPED
A
LETTER
ON
OF

HARRY
RIPPED
OPEN
THE

WAS
LUCKY
BECAUSE

THE

THEY
WOULD
MOVE
UP
INTO

IN
THE

DECIDED
THAT

LUCKY
THAT

HAD
ALSO
TENT
HIM
QUIDDITCH
THROUGH
THE

WHICH
TURNED
OUT
TO
BE
VERY
INTERESTING
READ
HARRY
LEARNED
THAT
THERE
WERE
SEVEN
HUNDRED
WAYS
OF
COMMITTING
QUIDDITCH
FOUL
AND
THAT
ALL
OF
THEM
HAD
HAPPENED
DURING
A
WORLD
MATCH
IN

THAT

USUALLY
THE
SMALLEST

PLAYERS
AND
THAT
MOST
SERIOUS
QUIDDITCH

SEEMED
TO
HAPPEN
THEM
THAT
ALTHOUGH

BEEN
KNOWN
TO
VANISH
AND
TURN
UP
MONTHS
LATER
IN
THE
SAHARA
DESERT
HERMIONE
HAD
BECOME
A
BIT
MORE
RELAXED
ABOUT
BREAKING
RULES
SINCE
AND
RON
HAD
SAVED
HER
FROM
THE
MOUNTAIN
TROLL
AND
SHE
WAS
MUCH
FOR
IT
THE
DAY
BEFORE

OUT
IN
THE
FREEZING
COURTYARD
DURING

AND
SHE
HAD
THEM
UP
A
BRIGHT
BLUE
FIRE
THAT
COULD
BE
CARRIED
AROUND
IN
A
JAM
JAR
THEY
WERE
STANDING
WITH
THEIR
BACKS
TO
IT
GETTING
WARM
WHEN
CROSSED
THE

HARRY
NOTICED
AT
ONCE
THAT
SNAPE
WAS
LIMPING
HARRY
RON
AND
HERMIONE
MOVED
CLOSER
TOGETHER
TO
BLOCK
THE
FIRE
FROM
VIEW
THEY
WERE
SURE
IT
WOULDN'T
BE
ALLOWED
UNFORTUNATELY
SOMETHING
THEIR
GUILTY
FACES
CAUGHT
SNAPE'S
EYE
HE
LIMPED
OVER
HE
HADN'T
THE
FIRE
BUT
HE
SEEMED
TO
BE
LOOKING
FOR
A
REASON
TO
TELL
THEM
ANYWAY
"WHAT'S
THAT
YOU'VE
GOT
THERE
POTTER
IT
WAS
QUIDDITCH
THROUGH
THE
AGES
HARRY
SHOWED
HIM
"LIBRARY

"GIVE

HARRY
MUTTERED
ANGRILY
AS

BUT
BY
ASKING
HER
TO

IT
THROUGH

GOT
THE

ANYWAY
HARRY
FELT
RESTLESS
HE
WANTED
QUIDDITCH
THROUGH
THE
AGES
BACK
TO
HIS
MIND
OFF
HIS
NERVES
ABOUT
TOMORROW
WHY
SHOULD
HE
BE
AFRAID
SNAPE
GETTING

HE
TOLD
RON
AND
HERMIONE
HE
WAS
GOING
TO
ASK
SNAPE
HE
COULD
HAVE
IT
"BETTER

THEY
SAID
TOGETHER
BUT
HARRY
HAD
AN
IDEA
SNAPE
WOULDN'T
REFUSE
IF
THERE
WERE

MADE
HIS
WAY
DOWN
TO

KNOCKED

SQUAWKED
THE

HARRY
SAID
NOTHING
HE
QUICKLY
DOWN
THE
CORRIDOR
WHERE
SHOULD
HE
GO
HE
STOPPED
HIS
HEART
RACING
AND
THOUGHT
AND
IT
CAME
TO
HIM
THE
RESTRICTED
SECTION
IN
THE
LIBRARY
HE'D
BE
ABLE
READ
AS
LONG
AS
HE
LIKED
AS
LONG
AS
IT
TOOK
TO

TIGHT
AROUND

WAS
PITCH
BLACK
AND
VERY
EERIE
HARRY
LIT
A
LAMP
TO
SEE
WAY
ALONG
THE
ROWS
OF
BOOKS
THE
LAMP
LOOKED
AS
IF
IT
WAS
FLOATING
IN
MIDAIR
AND
EVEN
THOUGH
HARRY
COULD
FEEL
HIS
ARM
SUPPORTING
IT
SIGHT
GAVE
HIM
THE
CREEPS
THE
RESTRICTED
SECTION
WAS
RIGHT
AT
THE
BACK
OF
THE
LIBRARY
STEP
CAREFULLY
OVER
THE
ROPE
THAT
SEPARATED
THESE
BOOKS
FROM
THE
REST
OF

HE
HELD
UP
HIS
LAMP
TO
READ
THE
TITLES
THEY
DIDN'T
TELL
HIM
MUCH
THEIR
PEELING
FADED
GOLD
LETTERS
WORDS
IN

HARRY
COULDN'T
UNDERSTAND
SOME
HAD
NO

AT
ALL
ONE

HAD
A
DARK
STAIN
ON
IT
THAT
LOOKED
HORRIBLY
LIKE
BLOOD
HAIRS
ON
THE
BACK
OF
HARRY'S
NECK
PRICKLED
MAYBE
HE
WAS
IMAGINING
IT
MAYBE
NOT
BUT
HE
THOUGHT
A
FAINT
WHISPERING
WAS
COMING
FROM
THE
BOOKS
AS
THOUGH
THEY
KNEW
SOMEONE
WAS
THERE
WHO
SHOULDN'T
BE
HE
HAD
TO
START
SOMEWHERE
SETTING
THE
LAMP
DOWN
CAREFULLY
ON
THE
FLOOR
HE
LOOKED
ALONG
THE
BOTTOM
SHELF
FOR
AN
INTERESTINGLOOKING
BOOK
A
BLACK
AND
SILVER
VOLUME
CAUGHT
HIS
EYE
HE
PULLED
IT
OUT
DIFFICULTY
BECAUSE
IT
WAS
VERY
HEAVY
AND
BALANCING
IT
ON
HIS
KNEE
LET
IT
FALL
OPEN
A
PIERCING
BLOODCURDLING
SHRIEK
SPLIT
THE
SILENCE
THE
BOOK
SCREAMING
HARRY
SNAPPED
IT
SHUT
BUT
THE
SHRIEK
WENT
ON
AND
ON
HIGH
UNBROKEN
EARSPLITTING
NOTE
HE
STUMBLED
BACKWARD
AND
KNOCKED
HIS
LAMP
WHICH
WENT
OUT
AT
ONCE
PANICKING
HE
HEARD
FOOTSTEPS
DOWN
THE
CORRIDOR
OUTSIDE
STUFFING
THE
SHRIEKING
BOOK
BACK
ON
SHELF
HE
RAN
FOR
IT
HE
PASSED
FILCH
IN
THE
DOORWAY
FILCH'S
PALE
EYES
LOOKED
STRAIGHT
THROUGH
HIM
AND
HARRY
SLIPPED
UNDER
OUTSTRETCHED
ARM
AND
STREAKED
OFF
UP
THE
CORRIDOR
THE
BOOK'S
STILL
RINGING
IN
HIS
EARS
HE
CAME
TO
A
SUDDEN
HALT
IN
FRONT
OF
A
TALL
SUIT
OF
ARMOR
HE
HAD
SO
BUSY
GETTING
AWAY
FROM
THE
LIBRARY
HE
HADN'T
PAID
ATTENTION
TO
HE
WAS
GOING
PERHAPS
BECAUSE
IT
WAS
DARK
HE
DIDN'T
RECOGNIZE
WHERE
WAS
AT
ALL
THERE
WAS
A
SUIT
OF
ARMOR
NEAR
THE
KITCHENS
HE
KNEW
BUT
MUST
BE
FIVE
FLOORS
ABOVE
THERE
"YOU
ASKED
ME
TO
COME
DIRECTLY
TO
YOU
PROFESSOR
IF
ANYONE
WANDERING
AROUND
AT
NIGHT

SOMEBODY'S

LIBRARY
SECTION
HARRY
FELT
THE
BLOOD
DRAIN
OUT
OF
HIS
FACE
WHEREVER
HE
WAS
FILCH
KNOW
A
SHORTCUT
BECAUSE
HIS
SOFT
GREASY
VOICE
WAS
GETTING
NEARER
TO
HIS
HORROR
IT
WAS
SNAPE
WHO
REPLIED
"THE
RESTRICTED
SECTION
WELL
THEY
CAN'T
BE
FAR
WE'LL
CATCH
THEM
HARRY
STOOD
ROOTED
TO
THE
SPOT
AS
FILCH
AND
SNAPE
CAME
AROUND
THE
AHEAD
THEY
COULDN'T
SEE
HIM
OF
COURSE
BUT
IT
WAS
A
NARROW
AND
IF
THEY
CAME
MUCH
NEARER
THEY'D
KNOCK
RIGHT
INTO
HIM
THE
DIDN'T
STOP
HIM
FROM
BEING
SOLID
HE
BACKED
AWAY
AS
QUIETLY
AS
HE
COULD
A
DOOR
STOOD
AJAR
TO
HIS
LEFT
WAS
HIS
ONLY
HOPE
HE
SQUEEZED
THROUGH
IT
HOLDING
HIS
BREATH
NOT
TO
MOVE
IT
AND
TO
HIS
RELIEF
HE
MANAGED
TO
GET
INSIDE
THE
WITHOUT
THEIR
NOTICING
ANYTHING
THEY
WALKED
STRAIGHT
PAST
AND
LEANED
AGAINST
THE
WALL
BREATHING
DEEPLY
LISTENING
TO
THEIR
DYING
AWAY
THAT
HAD
BEEN
CLOSE
VERY
CLOSE
IT
WAS
A
FEW
SECONDS
HE
NOTICED
ANYTHING
ABOUT
THE
ROOM
HE
HAD
HIDDEN
IN
IT
LOOKED
LIKE
AN
UNUSED
CLASSROOM
THE
DARK
SHAPES
OF
DESKS
AND
WERE
PILED
AGAINST
THE
WALLS
AND
THERE
WAS
AN
UPTURNED
BASKET
BUT
PROPPED
AGAINST
THE
WALL
FACING
HIM
WAS
SOMETHING
DIDN'T
LOOK
AS
IF
IT
BELONGED
THERE
SOMETHING
THAT
LOOKED
AS
IF
HAD
JUST
PUT
IT
THERE
TO
KEEP
IT
OUT
OF
THE
WAY
IT
WAS
A
MAGNIFICENT
MIRROR
AS
HIGH
AS
THE
CEILING
WITH
AN
ORNATE
FRAME
STANDING
ON
TWO
CLAWED
FEET
THERE
WAS
AN
INSCRIPTION
AROUND
THE
TOP
ERISED
STRA
EHRU

CAFRU
OYT
ON

HIS
FADING
NOW
THAT
THERE
WAS
NO
SOUND
OF

AND
SNAPE
HARRY
NEARER
TO
THE
MIRROR
WANTING
TO
LOOK
AT
HIMSELF
BUT
SEE
NO
AGAIN
HE
STEPPED
IN
FRONT
OF
IT
HE
HAD
TO
CLAP
HIS
HANDS
TO
HIS
MOUTH
TO
STOP
HIMSELF
FROM
SCREAMING
WHIRLED
AROUND
HIS
HEART
WAS
POUNDING
FAR
MORE
FURIOUSLY
THAN
WHEN
BOOK
HAD
SCREAMED
FOR
HE
HAD
SEEN
NOT
ONLY
HIMSELF
IN
THE
MIRROR
A
WHOLE
CROWD
OF
PEOPLE
STANDING
RIGHT
BEHIND
HIM
BUT
THE
ROOM
WAS
EMPTY
BREATHING
VERY
FAST
HE
TURNED
SLOWLY
BACK
THE
MIRROR
THERE
HE
WAS
REFLECTED
IN
IT
WHITE
AND
SCARED
LOOKING
AND
THERE
REFLECTED
BEHIND
HIM
WERE
AT
LEAST
TEN
OTHERS
HARRY
LOOKED
OVER
SHOULDER
BUT
STILL
NO
ONE
WAS
THERE
OR
WERE
THEY
ALL
INVISIBLE
TOO
WAS
HE
IN
FACT
IN
A
ROOM
FULL
OF
INVISIBLE
PEOPLE
AND
THIS
TRICK
WAS
THAT
IT
REFLECTED
THEM
INVISIBLE
OR
NOT
HE
LOOKED
IN
THE
MIRROR
AGAIN
A
WOMAN
STANDING
RIGHT
BEHIND
REFLECTION
WAS
SMILING
AT
HIM
AND
WAVING
HE
REACHED
OUT
A
HAND
AND
THE
AIR
BEHIND
HIM
IF
SHE
WAS
REALLY
THERE
HE'D
TOUCH
HER
REFLECTIONS
WERE
SO
CLOSE
TOGETHER
BUT
HE
FELT
ONLY
AIR
SHE
AND
OTHERS
EXISTED
ONLY
IN
THE
MIRROR
SHE
WAS
A
VERY
PRETTY
WOMAN
SHE
HAD
DARK
RED
HAIR
AND
HER
EYES
EYES
ARE
JUST
LIKE
MINE
HARRY
THOUGHT
EDGING
A
LITTLE
CLOSER
TO
GLASS
BRIGHT
GREEN
EXACTLY
THE
SAME
SHAPE
BUT
THEN
HE
NOTICED
SHE
WAS
CRYING
SMILING
BUT
CRYING
AT
THE
SAME
TIME
THE
TALL
THIN
BLACK
HAIRED
MAN
STANDING
NEXT
TO

HIS

AROUND

AND
HIS

UNTIDY

STUCK
UP
AT
THE
BACK
JUST
HARRY'S

HARRY
WAS
SO
CLOSE
TO
THE

NOW
THAT
HIS

WAS
NEARLY
THAT

JUST
LOOKED
AT

SMILING
AND
SLOWLY
HARRY
LOOKED
INTO
FACES
OF
THE
OTHER
PEOPLE
IN
THE
MIRROR
AND
SAW
OTHER
PAIRS
OF
EYES
LIKE
HIS
OTHER
NOSES
LIKE
HIS
EVEN
A
LITTLE
OLD
MAN
WHO
LOOKED

WAVED
AT

HE
STARED
HUNGRILY
BACK

PRESSED
FLAT
AGAINST
THE
GLASS
AS
THOUGH
HE
WAS
TO
FALL
RIGHT
THROUGH
IT
AND
REACH
THEM
HE
HAD
A
POWERFUL
KIND
OF
INSIDE
HIM
HALF
JOY
HALF
TERRIBLE
SADNESS
HOW
LONG
HE
STOOD
THERE
HE
DIDN'T
KNOW
THE
REFLECTIONS
DID
NOT

HE
LOOKED
AND
LOOKED
UNTIL
A
DISTANT
NOISE
BROUGHT
HIM
BACK
TO
SENSES
HE
COULDN'T
STAY
HERE
HE
HAD
TO
FIND
HIS
WAY
BACK

PASSED
THE
GHOST
OF
A

WAS
TO

ACROSS

THAT
NOW
WHY
DON'T

ONLY
WHEN

WAS
BACK
IN

THAT
IT
STRUCK
HARRY
THAT
MIGHT
NOT
HAVE
BEEN
QUITE
TRUTHFUL

THEN
HE
THOUGHT
AS
HE
SCABBERS
OFF
HIS

IT
HAD
BEEN
QUITE
A
PERSONAL
QUESTION
CHAPTER
NICOLAS
DUMBLEDORE
HAD
CONVINCED
HARRY
NOT
TO
GO
LOOKING
FOR
THE

ERISED
AGAIN
AND
FOR
THE
REST
OF
THE
CHRISTMAS
HOLIDAYS
INVISIBILITY

STAYED
FOLDED
AT
THE
BOTTOM
OF
HIS
TRUNK
WISHED
HE
COULD
FORGET
WHAT
HE'D
SEEN
IN
THE
MIRROR
AS
EASILY
BUT
COULDN'T
HE
STARTED
HAVING
NIGHTMARES
OVER
AND
OVER
AGAIN
HE
ABOUT
HIS
PARENTS
DISAPPEARING
IN
A
FLASH
OF
GREEN
LIGHT
WHILE
A
VOICE
CACKLED
WITH
LAUGHTER
"YOU

WAS
RIGHT
THAT

COULD
DRIVE
YOU
MAD

RON
WHEN
HARRY
TOLD
HIM
ABOUT
THESE
DREARNS
HERMIONE
WHO
CAME
BACK
THE
DAY
BEFORE
TERM
STARTED
TOOK
A
VIEW
OF
THINGS
SHE
WAS
TORN
BETWEEN
HORROR
AT
THE
IDEA
OF
HARRY
OUT
OF
BED
ROAMING
THE
SCHOOL
THREE
NIGHTS
IN
A
ROW
("IF

CAUGHT
YOU
")
AND
DISAPPOINTMENT
THAT
HE
HADN'T
AT

FOUND
OUT
NICOLAS
FLAMEL
WAS
THEY
HAD
ALMOST
GIVEN
UP
HOPE
OF
EVER
FINDING

IN
A
LI

THOUGH
HARRY
WAS
STILL
SURE
HE'D
READ
THE
NAME
SOMEWHERE
ONCE

HAD
STARTED
THEY
WERE
BACK
TO
SKIMMING
THROUGH
BOOKS
FOR
MINUTES
DURING
THEIR
BREAKS
HARRY
HAD
EVEN
LESS

THAN
THE
TWO
BECAUSE

HAD
STARTED
AGAIN

WAS
WORKING

HARDER
THAN

REPLACED

DAMPEN
HIS
SPIRITS
THE
COMPLAINED
THAT
WOOD
WAS
BECOMING
A
FANATIC
BUT
HARRY
WAS
ON
SIDE
IF
THEY
WON
THEIR
NEXT
MATCH
AGAINST
HUFFLEPUFF
THEY
OVERTAKE
SLYTHERIN
IN
THE
HOUSE
CHAMPIONSHIP
FOR
THE
FIRST
TIME
IN
YEARS
QUITE
APART
FROM
WANTING
TO
WIN
HARRY
FOUND
THAT
HE
HAD
NIGHTMARES
WHEN
HE
WAS
TIRED
OUT
AFTER

THEN
DURING
ONE
PARTICULARLY
WET
AND
MUDDY
PRACTICE
SESSION
WOOD
THE

A
BIT
OF
BAD
NEWS
HE'D
JUST
GOTTEN
VERY
ANGRY
WITH
WEASLEYS
WHO
KEPT
DIVE
BOMBING
EACH
OTHER
AND
PRETENDING
TO
FALL
THEIR
BROOMS
"WILL
YOU
STOP
MESSING
AROUND

HE
YELLED
"THAT'S
EXACTLY
THE
SORT
THING
THAT'LL
LOSE
US
THE

REFEREEING
THIS
TIME
AND
BE
LOOKING

REALLY
DID
FALL
OFF
HIS

AT
THESE

SPLUTTERED
THROUGH
A
MOUTHFUL
OF

EVER
REFEREED
A

NOT
GOING

"IT'S
NOT
MY
FAULT

SAID
WOOD
"WE'VE
JUST
GOT
TO
MAKE

SNAPE
HASN'T
GOT
AN

WAS

ANYONE
WOULD

REMEMBERED
ABOUT

HE
TOLD

"IF

DON'T

I'M
JUST

DREW
NEARER
HOWEVER
HARRY
BECAME
MORE
AND
MORE
NERVOUS
WHATEVER
HE
TOLD
RON
AND
HERMIONE
THE
REST
OF
THE

WASN'T
TOO
CALM
EITHER
THE
IDEA
OF
OVERTAKING
SLYTHERIN
IN
THE
HOUSE
CHAMPIONSHIP
WONDERFUL
NO
ONE
HAD
DONE
IT
FOR
SEVEN
YEARS
BUT
WOULD
THEY
BE
TO
WITH
SUCH
A
BIASED
REFEREE
HARRY
DIDN'T
KNOW
WHETHER
HE
WAS
IMAGINING
IT
OR
NOT

HE
SEEMED
KEEP

WHEREVER
HE
WENT
AT

EVEN
WHETHER

WAS
FOLLOWING
HIM
TRYING
TO
CATCH
HIM
ON
HIS

WERE
TURNING
INTO
A

OF
WEEKLY
TORTURE
SNAPE
WAS
HORRIBLE
TO
HARRY
COULD
SNAPE
POSSIBLY
KNOW
THEY'D
FOUND
OUT
ABOUT

HARRY
DIDN'T
SEE
HOW

COULD
YET
HE
SOMETIMES
THE
HORRIBLE
FEELING
THAT

COULD
READ

HARRY
KNEW
WHEN
THEY
WISHED
HIM
GOOD
LUCK
OUTSIDE
THE

ROOMS
NEXT
AFTERNOON
THAT
RON
AND
HERMIONE
WERE
WONDERING
WHETHER
THEY'D

THIS
WASN'T
WHAT
YOU'D
CALL

HARDLY
HEARD
A

AS
HE
PULLED
ON

COULDN'T
UNDERSTAND
WHY
THEY
LOOKED
SO
GRIM
AND
WORRIED
WHY
THEY
HAD
BOTH
BROUGHT
THEIR
WANDS
TO
THE

LITTLE
DID
KNOW
THAT
RON
AND
HERMIONE
HAD
BEEN
SECRETLY
PRACTICING
THE

CURSE
THEY'D
GOTTEN
THE
IDEA
FROM
MALFOY
USING
IT
ON
NEVILLE
AND
READY
TO
USE
IT
ON
SNAPE
IF
HE
SHOWED
ANY

TO
HURT
HARRY
"NOW

HARRY
TOLD
HERMIONE
"WE
GOT
TIME
TO
SEND
CHARLIE
ANOTHER

AND
THIS
COULD
BE

HE
PUFFED
"NORBERT'S
AT
A
TRICKY
STAGE
I
CAN'T
HANDLE
WHEN
THEY
TOLD
HIM
ABOUT
CHARLIE'S
LETTER
HIS
EYES
FILLED
WITH
TEARS
ALTHOUGH
THAT
MIGHT
HAVE
BEEN
BECAUSE
NORBERT
HAD
JUST
BITTEN

ON

WALKED
BACK

ENOUGH
THEY
WOULD
HAVE
FELT
SORRY
FOR
HAGRID
WHEN
THE

CAME
FOR

TO
NORBERT
IF
THEY
HADN'T
BEEN
SO
WORRIED
ABOUT
WHAT
THEY
TO
DO
IT
WAS
A
VERY
DARK
CLOUDY
NIGHT
AND
THEY
WERE
A
BIT
ARRIVING
AT
HAGRID'S
HUT
BECAUSE
THEY'D
HAD
TO
WAIT
FOR
PEEVES
TO
OUT
OF
THEIR
WAY
IN
THE
ENTRANCE
HALL
WHERE
HE'D
BEEN
PLAYING
AGAINST

LONELY
FROM

ALONG

ANOTHER

EASIER

HARRY
PANTED
AS
THEY
REACHED
THE

BENEATH

A
SUDDEN
MOVEMENT
AHEAD

MADE
THEM
ALMOST
DROP

MCGONAGALL

DEEPER
INTO

WHEN
A

SOUND
MADE
FREEZE
WHERE
HE
STOOD
A

ON
THE
EDGE
OF
THE

QUIVERED
THEN
OUT
OF

A

CAME
CRAWLING
ACROSS

TRANSFIXED

LET
OUT
A
TERRIBLE
SCREAM

DID
FANG
THE

RAISED
ITS

LOOKED
RIGHT
AT

DRIBBLING
DOWN
ITS

IT
GOT
TO
ITS

CAME
SWIFTLY
HARRY
HE
COULDN'T

FOR

THEN
A

GALLOPING
AND
SOMETHING
JUMPED
CLEAN

CHARGING
AT
THE

THE
PAIN
IN

WAS
SO

FELL
TO

THAT
IT
WAS
NOW
WORSE
THAN

BECAUSE
WAS
A
HOODED

MAYBE
IT
WAS
BECAUSE
THEY
